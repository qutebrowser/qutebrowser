# Pipes history, quickmarks, and URL into dmenu.
#
# If run from qutebrowser as a userscript, it runs :open on the URL
# If not, it opens a new qutebrowser window at the URL
#
# Ideal for use with tabs_are_windows. Set a hotkey to launch this script, then:
#	:bind o spawn --userscript dmenu_qutebrowser
#
# Use the hotkey to open in new tab/window, press 'o' to open URL in current tab/window
# You can simulate "go" by pressing "o<tab>", as the current URL is always first in the list
#
# I personally use "<Mod4>o" to launch this script. For me, my workflow is:
#	Default	keys		Keys with this script
#	O			<Mod4>o
#	o			o
#	go			o<Tab>
#	gO			gC, then o<Tab>
#				(This is unnecessarily long. I use this rarely, feel free to make this script accept parameters.)
