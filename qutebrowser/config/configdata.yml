    valid_values:
      - webengine: "Use QtWebEngine (based on Chromium - recommended)."
      - webkit: "Use QtWebKit (based on WebKit, similar to Safari - many known security
                issues!)."
  default: webengine
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    Backend to use to display websites.

    qutebrowser supports two different web rendering engines / backends,
    QtWebEngine and QtWebKit (not recommended).

    QtWebEngine is Qt's official successor to QtWebKit, and both the default/recommended
    backend. It's based on a stripped-down Chromium and regularly updated with security
    fixes and new features by the Qt project: https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine

    QtWebKit was qutebrowser's original backend when the project was started. However,
    support for QtWebKit was discontinued by the Qt project with Qt 5.6 in 2016. The
    development of QtWebKit was picked up in an official fork:
    https://github.com/qtwebkit/qtwebkit - however, the project seems to have stalled
    again. The latest release (5.212.0 Alpha 4) from March 2020 is based on a WebKit
    version from 2016, with many known security vulnerabilities. Additionally, there is
    no process isolation and sandboxing. Due to all those issues, while support for
    QtWebKit is still available in qutebrowser for now, using it is strongly
    discouraged.

  renamed: qt.args

qt.args:
  type:
    name: List
    valtype: String
    none_ok: true
  default: []
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    Additional arguments to pass to Qt, without leading `--`.

    With QtWebEngine, some Chromium arguments (see
    https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/ for a list)
    will work.

      none_ok: true
    none_ok: true
  default: {}
  restart: true
  desc: >-

    Setting an environment variable to null/None will unset it.

force_software_rendering:
  renamed: qt.force_software_rendering

qt.force_software_rendering:
  type:
    name: String
    valid_values:
      - software-opengl: Tell LibGL to use a software implementation of GL
            (`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE` / `QT_XCB_FORCE_SOFTWARE_OPENGL`)
      - qt-quick: Tell Qt Quick to use a software renderer instead of OpenGL.
            (`QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software`)
      - chromium: Tell Chromium to disable GPU support and use Skia software
            rendering instead. (`--disable-gpu`)
      - none: Don't force software rendering.
  default: none
  backend: QtWebEngine
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    Force software rendering for QtWebEngine.

    This is needed for QtWebEngine to work with Nouveau drivers and can be
    useful in other scenarios related to graphic issues.

qt.force_platform:
  type:
    name: String
    none_ok: true
  default: null
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    Force a Qt platform to use.

    This sets the `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` environment variable and is useful to force
    using the XCB plugin when running QtWebEngine on Wayland.

qt.force_platformtheme:
  type:
    name: String
    none_ok: true
  default: null
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    Force a Qt platformtheme to use.

    This sets the `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME` environment variable which controls
    dialogs like the filepicker. By default, Qt determines the platform theme
    based on the desktop environment.

qt.process_model:
  renamed: qt.chromium.process_model

qt.chromium.process_model:
  type:
    name: String
    valid_values:
      - process-per-site-instance: Pages from separate sites are put into
            separate processes and separate visits to the same site are also
            isolated.
      - process-per-site: Pages from separate sites are put into separate
            processes. Unlike Process per Site Instance, all visits to the same
            site will share an OS process. The benefit of this model is reduced
            memory consumption, because more web pages will share processes.
            The drawbacks include reduced security, robustness, and
            responsiveness.
      - single-process: Run all tabs in a single process. This should be used
            for debugging purposes only, and it disables `:open --private`.
  default: process-per-site-instance
  backend: QtWebEngine
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    Which Chromium process model to use.

    Alternative process models use less resources, but decrease security and
    robustness.

    See the following pages for more details:

      - https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models
      - https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebengine-features.html#process-models

qt.low_end_device_mode:
  renamed: qt.chromium.low_end_device_mode

qt.chromium.low_end_device_mode:
  type:
    name: String
    valid_values:
      - always: Always use low-end device mode.
      - auto: Decide automatically (uses low-end mode with < 1 GB available
            RAM).
      - never: Never use low-end device mode.
  default: auto
  backend: QtWebEngine
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    When to use Chromium's low-end device mode.

    This improves the RAM usage of renderer processes, at the expense of
    performance.

qt.chromium.sandboxing:
  type:
    name: String
    valid_values:
      - enable-all: Enable all available sandboxing mechanisms.
      - disable-seccomp-bpf: Disable the Seccomp BPF filter sandbox (Linux only).
      - disable-all: Disable all sandboxing (**not recommended!**).
  default: enable-all
  backend: QtWebEngine
  restart: true
  no_autoconfig: true  # due to it being dangerous
  # yamllint disable rule:line-length
  desc: >-
    What sandboxing mechanisms in Chromium to use.

    Chromium has various sandboxing layers, which should be enabled for normal
    browser usage. Mainly for testing and development, it's possible to disable
    individual sandboxing layers via this setting.

    Open `chrome://sandbox` to see the current sandbox status.

    Changing this setting is only recommended if you know what you're doing, as
    it **disables one of Chromium's security layers**. To avoid sandboxing being
    accidentally disabled persistently, this setting can only be set via
    `config.py`, not via `:set`.

    See the Chromium documentation for more details:

    - https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/\+/HEAD/docs/linux/sandboxing.md[Linux]

  # yamllint enable rule:line-length

qt.highdpi:
  type: Bool
  default: false
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    Turn on Qt HighDPI scaling.

    This is equivalent to setting QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1 or
    QT_ENABLE_HIGHDPI_SCALING=1 (Qt >= 5.14) in the environment.

    It's off by default as it can cause issues with some bitmap fonts.
    As an alternative to this, it's possible to set font sizes and the
    `zoom.default` setting.

qt.workarounds.remove_service_workers:
  type: Bool
  default: false
  desc: >-
    Delete the QtWebEngine Service Worker directory on every start.

    This workaround can help with certain crashes caused by an unknown QtWebEngine bug
    related to Service Workers. Those crashes happen seemingly immediately on Windows;
    after one hour of operation on other systems.

    Note however that enabling this option *can lead to data loss* on some pages (as
    Service Worker data isn't persisted) and will negatively impact start-up time.

qt.workarounds.locale:
  type: Bool
  default: false
  backend: QtWebEngine
  desc: >-
    Work around locale parsing issues in QtWebEngine 5.15.3.

    With some locales, QtWebEngine 5.15.3 is unusable without this workaround.
    In affected scenarios, QtWebEngine will log "Network service crashed,
    restarting service." and only display a blank page.

    However, It is expected that distributions shipping QtWebEngine 5.15.3
    follow up with a proper fix soon, so it is disabled by default.

## auto_save

auto_save.interval:
  type:
    name: Int
    minval: 0
    maxval: maxint
  default: 15000
  desc: Time interval (in milliseconds) between auto-saves of
    config/cookies/etc.

auto_save.session:
  type: Bool
  default: false
  desc: >-
    Always restore open sites when qutebrowser is reopened.

    Without this option set, `:wq` (`:quit --save`) needs to be used to save
    open tabs (and restore them), while quitting qutebrowser in any other way
    will not save/restore the session.

    By default, this will save to the session which was last loaded. This
    behavior can be customized via the `session.default_name` setting.

## content

content.autoplay:
  default: true
  type: Bool
  backend: QtWebEngine
  supports_pattern: true
  desc: >-
    Automatically start playing `<video>` elements.

content.cache.size:
  default: null
  type:
    name: Int
    none_ok: true
    minval: 0
    maxval: maxint64
  desc: >-
    Size (in bytes) of the HTTP network cache. Null to use the default value.

    With QtWebEngine, the maximum supported value is 2147483647 (~2 GB).

content.canvas_reading:
  default: true
  type: Bool
  backend: QtWebEngine
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    Allow websites to read canvas elements.

    Note this is needed for some websites to work properly.

# Defaults from QWebSettings::QWebSettings() in
# qtwebkit/Source/WebKit/qt/Api/qwebsettings.cpp

content.cache.maximum_pages:
  default: 0
  type:
    name: Int
    minval: 0
    maxval: maxint
  backend: QtWebKit
  desc: >-
    Maximum number of pages to hold in the global memory page cache.

    The page cache allows for a nicer user experience when navigating forth or
    back to pages in the forward/back history, by pausing and resuming up to
    _n_ pages.

    For more information about the feature, please refer to:
    https://webkit.org/blog/427/webkit-page-cache-i-the-basics/

content.cache.appcache:
  default: true
  type: Bool
  backend: QtWebKit
  supports_pattern: true
  desc: >-
    Enable support for the HTML 5 web application cache feature.

    An application cache acts like an HTTP cache in some sense. For documents
    that use the application cache via JavaScript, the loader engine will first
    ask the application cache for the contents, before hitting the network.

content.cookies.accept:
  default: all
  supports_pattern: true
  type:
    name: String
    valid_values:
      - all: "Accept all cookies."
      - no-3rdparty: "Accept cookies from the same origin only. This is known
          to break some sites, such as GMail."
      - no-unknown-3rdparty: "Accept cookies from the same origin only, unless
          a cookie is already set for the domain. On QtWebEngine, this is the
          same as no-3rdparty."
      - never: "Don't accept cookies at all."
  desc: >-
    Which cookies to accept.

    With QtWebEngine, this setting also controls other features with tracking
    capabilities similar to those of cookies; including IndexedDB, DOM storage,
    filesystem API, service workers, and AppCache.

    Note that with QtWebKit, only `all` and `never` are supported as per-domain
    values. Setting `no-3rdparty` or `no-unknown-3rdparty` per-domain on
    QtWebKit will have the same effect as `all`.

    If this setting is used with URL patterns, the pattern gets applied to the
    origin/first party URL of the page making the request, not the request URL.

    With QtWebEngine 5.15.0+, paths will be stripped from URLs, so URL patterns
    using paths will not match. With QtWebEngine 5.15.2+, subdomains are
    additionally stripped as well, so you will typically need to set this
    setting for `example.com` when the cookie is set on
    `somesubdomain.example.com` for it to work properly.

    To debug issues with this setting, start qutebrowser with `--debug
    --logfilter network --debug-flag log-cookies` which will show all cookies
    being set.

content.cookies.store:
  default: true
  type: Bool
  desc: Store cookies.

content.default_encoding:
  type: String
  default: iso-8859-1
  desc: >-
    Default encoding to use for websites.

    The encoding must be a string describing an encoding such as _utf-8_,
    _iso-8859-1_, etc.

content.unknown_url_scheme_policy:
  type:
    name: String
    valid_values:
      - disallow: "Disallows all navigation requests to URLs with unknown
          schemes."
      - allow-from-user-interaction: "Allows navigation requests to URLs with
          unknown schemes that are issued from user-interaction (like a
          mouse-click), whereas other navigation requests (for example from
          JavaScript) are suppressed."
      - allow-all: "Allows all navigation requests to URLs with unknown
          schemes."
  default: allow-from-user-interaction
  backend: QtWebEngine
  supports_pattern: true
  desc: >-
    How navigation requests to URLs with unknown schemes are handled.

content.windowed_fullscreen:
  renamed: content.fullscreen.window

content.fullscreen.window:
  type: Bool
  default: false
  desc: >-
    Limit fullscreen to the browser window (does not expand to fill the screen).

content.fullscreen.overlay_timeout:
  type:
    name: Int
    minval: 0
    maxval: maxint
  default: 3000
  desc: >-
    Set fullscreen notification overlay timeout in milliseconds.

    If set to 0, no overlay will be displayed.

content.desktop_capture:
  type: BoolAsk
  default: ask
  supports_pattern: true
  desc: Allow websites to share screen content.

content.developer_extras:
  deleted: true

content.dns_prefetch:
  default: true
  type: Bool
  backend: QtWebEngine
  supports_pattern: true
  desc: Try to pre-fetch DNS entries to speed up browsing.

content.frame_flattening:
  default: false
  type: Bool
  backend: QtWebKit
  supports_pattern: true
  desc: >-
    Expand each subframe to its contents.

    This will flatten all the frames to become one scrollable page.

content.prefers_reduced_motion:
  default: false
  type: Bool
  backend:
    QtWebEngine: Qt 5.14
    QtWebKit: false
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    Request websites to minimize non-essentials animations and motion.

    This results in the `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media query to evaluate to
    `reduce` (rather than `no-preference`).

    On Windows, if this setting is set to False, the system-wide animation
    setting is considered.

content.site_specific_quirks:
  renamed: content.site_specific_quirks.enabled

content.site_specific_quirks.enabled:
  default: true
  restart: true
  type: Bool
  desc: 'Enable quirks (such as faked user agent headers) needed to get
      specific sites to work properly.'

content.site_specific_quirks.skip:

    none_ok: true
  default: ["js-string-replaceall"]
  desc: >-
    Disable a list of named quirks.

    The js-string-replaceall quirk is needed for Nextcloud Calendar < 2.2.0 with
    QtWebEngine < 5.15.3. However, the workaround is not fully compliant to the
    ECMAScript spec and might cause issues on other websites, so it's disabled by
    default.

  supports_pattern: true
  desc: Allow websites to request geolocations.

content.mouse_lock:

  backend: QtWebEngine
  desc: Allow websites to lock your mouse pointer.

content.headers.accept_language:

    none_ok: true
    encoding: ascii
  supports_pattern: true
  default: en-US,en;q=0.9

  default: true
  supports_pattern: true
  desc: >-
    Value to send in the `DNT` header.

    When this is set to true, qutebrowser asks websites to not track your
    identity. If set to null, the DNT header is not sent at all.

content.headers.referer:

    valid_values:
      - always: "Always send the Referer."
      - never: "Never send the Referer. This is not recommended, as some sites

          with stripped path information."
  restart: true
  desc: >-
    When to send the Referer header.

    The Referer header tells websites from which website you were coming from
    when visiting them. Note that with QtWebEngine, websites can override this
    preference by setting the `Referrer-Policy:` header, so that any websites
    visited from them get the full referer.

    No restart is needed with QtWebKit.

    * `{qutebrowser_version}`: The currently running qutebrowser version.

    The default value is equal to the unchanged user agent of
    QtWebKit/QtWebEngine.

    Note that the value read from JavaScript is always the global value. With
    QtWebEngine between 5.12 and 5.14 (inclusive), changing the value exposed
    to JavaScript requires a restart.

  desc: |
    List of URLs to host blocklists for the host blocker.

    Only used when the simple host-blocker is used (see `content.blocking.method`).

    The file can be in one of the following formats:

    - An `/etc/hosts`-like file
    - One host per line
    - A zip-file of any of the above, with either only one file, or a file
      named `hosts` (with any extension).

    It's also possible to add a local file or directory via a `file://` URL. In
    case of a directory, all files in the directory are read as adblock lists.

    The file `~/.config/qutebrowser/blocked-hosts` is always read if it exists.

content.blocking.hosts.block_subdomains:
  default: true
  type: Bool
  desc: >-
    Block subdomains of blocked hosts.

    Note: If only a single subdomain is blocked but should be allowed, consider
    using `content.blocking.whitelist` instead.

content.blocking.method:

      - both: Use both hosts blocking and Brave's ABP-style adblocker
  desc: |
    Which method of blocking ads should be used.

    Support for Adblock Plus (ABP) syntax blocklists using Brave's Rust library requires
    the `adblock` Python package to be installed, which is an optional dependency of
    qutebrowser. It is required when either `adblock` or `both` are selected.

content.blocking.adblock.lists:
  default:
    - "https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt"
    - "https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt"
  type:
    name: List
    valtype: Url
    none_ok: true
  desc: |
    List of URLs to ABP-style adblocking rulesets.

    Only used when Brave's ABP-style adblocker is used (see `content.blocking.method`).

    You can find an overview of available lists here:
    https://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions - note that the special
    `subscribe.adblockplus.org` links aren't handled by qutebrowser, you will instead
    need to find the link to the raw `.txt` file (e.g. by extracting it from the
    `location` parameter of the subscribe URL and URL-decoding it).

content.blocking.whitelist:
  default: []
  type:

    valtype: UrlPattern
    none_ok: true
  desc: >-
    A list of patterns that should always be loaded, despite being blocked by the
    ad-/host-blocker.

    Local domains are always exempt from adblocking.

    Note this whitelists otherwise blocked requests, not first-party URLs. As
    an example, if `example.org` loads an ad from `ads.example.org`, the
    whitelist entry could be `https://ads.example.org/*`. If you want to
    disable the adblocker on a given page, use the
    `content.blocking.enabled` setting with a URL pattern instead.

content.hyperlink_auditing:

  default:
    unknown: debug
    info: debug
    warning: debug
    error: debug
  desc: >-
    Log levels to use for JavaScript console logging messages.

    When a JavaScript message with the level given in the dictionary key is
    logged, the corresponding dictionary value selects the qutebrowser logger
    to use.

    On QtWebKit, the "unknown" setting is always used.

    The following levels are valid: `none`, `debug`, `info`, `warning`,
    `error`.

    valid_values:
      - auto: Tries `libnotify`, `systray` and `messages`, uses the first one available
            without showing error messages.
      - qt: Use Qt's native notification presenter, based on a system tray icon.
            Switching from or to this value requires a restart of qutebrowser.
            Recommended over `systray` on PyQt 5.14.
      - libnotify: Shows messages via DBus in a libnotify-compatible way. If DBus isn't
            available, falls back to `systray` or `messages`, but shows an error
            message.
      - systray: Use a notification presenter based on a systray icon. Falls back to
            `libnotify` or `messages` if not systray is available. This is a
            reimplementation of the `qt` setting value, but with the possibility to
            switch to it at runtime.
      - messages: Show notifications as qutebrowser messages. Most notification features
            aren't available.
      - herbe: (experimental!) Show notifications using herbe (github.com/dudik/herbe).
            Most notification features aren't available.
  backend:

  desc: >-
    What notification presenter to use for web notifications.

    Note that not all implementations support all features of notifications:

    - With PyQt 5.14, any setting other than `qt` does not support  the `click` and
      `close` events, as well as the `tag` option to replace existing notifications.
    - The `qt` and `systray` options only support showing one notification at the time
      and ignore the `tag` option to replace existing notifications.
    - The `herbe` option only supports showing one notification at the time and doesn't
      show icons.
    - The `messages` option doesn't show icons and doesn't support the `click` and
      `close` events.

content.notifications.show_origin:
  default: true
  type: Bool
  supports_pattern: true
  backend:
    QtWebEngine: Qt 5.14
    QtWebKit: false
  desc: >-
    Whether to show the origin URL for notifications.

    Note that URL patterns with this setting only get matched against the origin part of
    the URL, so e.g. paths in patterns will never match.

    Note that with the `qt` presenter, origins are never shown.

content.pdfjs:
  default: false
  type: Bool
  supports_pattern: true
  desc: >-

    pages.

content.proxy:
  default: system
  type: Proxy
  desc: >-
    Proxy to use.

    In addition to the listed values, you can use a `socks://...` or
    `http://...` URL.

    Note that with QtWebEngine, it will take a couple of seconds until the
    change is applied, if this value is changed at runtime. Authentication for
    SOCKS proxies isn't supported due to Chromium limitations.

content.proxy_dns_requests:
  default: true
  type: Bool
  backend: QtWebKit
  desc: Send DNS requests over the configured proxy.

content.register_protocol_handler:

            to HSTS).
      - ask-block-thirdparty: Ask how to proceed for normal page loads, but silently
            block resource loads.
      - block: Automatically block loading on certificate errors.
      - load-insecurely: Force loading pages despite certificate errors. This is
            *insecure* and should be avoided. Instead of using this, consider fixing the
            underlying issue or importing a self-signed certificate via `certutil` (or
            Chromium) instead.

            bind them to discover public interfaces.
      - default-public-and-private-interfaces: WebRTC should only use the
            default route used by http. This also exposes the associated
            default private address. Default route is the route chosen by the
            OS on a multi-homed endpoint.
      - default-public-interface-only: WebRTC should only use the default route
            used by http. This doesn't expose any local addresses.
      - disable-non-proxied-udp: WebRTC should only use TCP to contact peers or
            servers unless the proxy server supports UDP. This doesn't expose
            any local addresses either.
  default: all-interfaces

    Which interfaces to expose via WebRTC.

content.xss_auditing:

  supports_pattern: true
  desc: >-
    Monitor load requests for cross-site scripting attempts.

    Suspicious scripts will be blocked and reported in the devtools
    JavaScript console.

    Note that bypasses for the XSS auditor are widely known and it can be
    abused for cross-site info leaks in some scenarios, see:
    https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/xss-auditor

content.mute:
  default: false
  type: Bool
  supports_pattern: true
  desc: >-
    Automatically mute tabs.

    Note that if the `:tab-mute` command is used, the mute status for the
    affected tab is now controlled manually, and this setting doesn't have any
    effect.

    Format of timestamps (e.g. for the history completion).

    See https://sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html and
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior

    This only affects the completion. Matching URLs are still saved in the
    history (and visible on the `:history` page), but hidden in the
    completion.

    Changing this setting will cause the completion history to be regenerated
    on the next start, which will take a short while.

downloads.prevent_mixed_content:
  type: Bool
  default: true
  supports_pattern: true
  desc:
    Automatically abort insecure (HTTP) downloads originating from secure
    (HTTPS) pages.

    For per-domain settings, the relevant URL is the URL initiating the
    download, not the URL the download itself is coming from. It's not
    recommended to set this setting to false globally.

downloads.remove_finished:
  default: -1
  type:

  desc: |
    Search engines which can be used via the address bar.

    Maps a search engine name (such as `DEFAULT`, or `ddg`) to a URL with a
    `{}` placeholder. The placeholder will be replaced by the search term, use
    `{{` and `}}` for literal `{`/`}` braces.

    The following further placeholds are defined to configure how special
    characters in the search terms are replaced by safe characters (called
    'quoting'):

    * `{}` and `{semiquoted}` quote everything except slashes; this is the most
      sensible choice for almost all search engines (for the search term
      `slash/and&amp` this placeholder expands to `slash/and%26amp`).
    * `{quoted}` quotes all characters (for `slash/and&amp` this placeholder
      expands to `slash%2Fand%26amp`).
    * `{unquoted}` quotes nothing (for `slash/and&amp` this placeholder
      expands to `slash/and&amp`).
    * `{0}` means the same as `{}`, but can be used multiple times.

    The search engine named `DEFAULT` is used when `url.auto_search` is turned
    on and something else than a URL was entered to be opened. Other search
    engines can be used by prepending the search engine name to the search
    term, e.g. `:open google qutebrowser`.

## keybindings

bindings.key_mappings:

    <Ctrl-M>: <Return>
    <Ctrl-J>: <Return>

    <Shift-Return>: <Return>
    <Enter>: <Return>
    <Shift-Enter>: <Return>
    <Ctrl-Enter>: <Ctrl-Return>
  type:
    name: Dict
    none_ok: true
    keytype: Key
    valtype: Key
  desc: >-
    Map keys to other keys, so that they are equivalent in all modes.

    When the key used as dictionary-key is pressed, the binding for the key
    used as dictionary-value is invoked instead.

    This is useful for global remappings of keys, for example to map <Ctrl-[> to
    <Escape>.

    NOTE: This should only be used if two keys should always be equivalent, i.e. for
    things like <Enter> (keypad) and <Return> (non-keypad). For normal command bindings,
    qutebrowser works differently to vim: You always bind keys to commands, usually via
    `:bind` or `config.bind()`. Instead of using this setting, consider finding the
    command a key is bound to (e.g. via `:bind gg`) and then binding the same command to
    the desired key.

    Note that when a key is bound (via `bindings.default` or
    `bindings.commands`), the mapping is ignored.

    Default keybindings. If you want to add bindings, modify
    `bindings.commands` instead.

    The main purpose of this setting is that you can set it to an empty
    dictionary if you want to load no default keybindings at all.

    If you want to preserve default bindings (and get new bindings when there
    is an update), use `config.bind()` in `config.py` or the `:bind` command,
    and leave this setting alone.

    Keybindings mapping keys to commands in different modes.

    While it's possible to add bindings with this setting, it's recommended to
    use `config.bind()` in `config.py` or the `:bind` command, and leave this
    setting alone.

    This setting is a dictionary containing mode names and dictionaries mapping
    keys to commands:

    `{mode: {key: command}}`

    If you want to map a key to another key, check the `bindings.key_mappings`
    setting instead.

    For modifiers, you can use either `-` or `+` as delimiters, and these
    names:

      * Control: `Control`, `Ctrl`

      * Meta:    `Meta`, `Windows`, `Mod4`

      * Alt:     `Alt`, `Mod1`

      * Shift:   `Shift`

    For simple keys (no `<>`-signs), a capital letter means the key is pressed
    with Shift. For special keys (with `<>`-signs), you need to explicitly add
    `Shift-` to match a key pressed with shift.

    If you want a binding to do nothing, bind it to the `nop` command.
    If you want a default binding to be passed through to the website, bind it
    to null.

    Note that some commands which are only useful for bindings (but not used
    interactively) are hidden from the command completion. See `:help` for a
    full list of available commands.

    The following modes are available:


    * normal: Default mode, where most commands are invoked.


    * insert: Entered when an input field is focused on a website, or by
      pressing `i` in normal mode. Passes through almost all keypresses to the
      website, but has some bindings like `<Ctrl-e>` to open an external
      editor. Note that single keys can't be bound in this mode.

    * hint: Entered when `f` is pressed to select links with the keyboard. Note
      that single keys can't be bound in this mode.

    * passthrough: Similar to insert mode, but passes through all keypresses
      except `<Escape>` to leave the mode. It might be useful to bind
      `<Escape>` to some other key in this mode if you want to be able to send
      an Escape key to the website as well. Note that single keys can't be
      bound in this mode.

    * command: Entered when pressing the `:` key in order to enter a command.
      Note that single keys can't be bound in this mode.

    * prompt: Entered when there's a prompt to display, like for download
      locations or when invoked from JavaScript.

    * yesno: Entered when there's a yes/no prompt displayed.

    * caret: Entered when pressing the `v` mode, used to select text using the
      keyboard.

    * register: Entered when qutebrowser is waiting for a register name/key for
      commands like `:set-mark`.
