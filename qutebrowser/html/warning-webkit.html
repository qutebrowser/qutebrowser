<span class="note">Note this warning will only appear once. Use <span class="mono">:open
qute://warning/webkit</span> to show it again at a later time.</span>

<p>You're using qutebrowser with the QtWebKit backend.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, QtWebKit hasn't seen a release (including security updates)
since June 2017, and it also lacks various security features (process
isolation/sandboxing) present in QtWebEngine.</p>

<p>Because of those security issues and the maintaince burden coming with
supporting QtWebKit, support for it will be dropped in a future qutebrowser
release. It's recommended that you use QtWebEngine instead.</p>

<h2>(Outdated) reasons to use QtWebKit</h2>
<p>Most reasons why people preferred the QtWebKit backend aren't relevant anymore:</p>

<p><b>PDF.js support</b>: This qutebrowser release comes with PDF.js support
for QtWebEngine.</p>

<p><b>Missing control over Referer header</b>: This qutebrowser release
supports <span class="mono">content.headers.referer</span> for QtWebEngine.</p>

<p><b>Missing control over cookies</b>: With Qt 5.11 or newer, the <span
class="mono">content.cookies.accept</span> setting works on QtWebEngine.</p>

<p><b>Graphical glitches</b>: The new values for the <span
class="mono">qt.force_software_rendering</span> setting added in v1.4.0 should
hopefully help.</p>

<p><b>Missing support for notifications</b>: Those <a
href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-29611">aren't supported yet</a> in
Qt, but support is planned to be added in Qt 5.13, released around May 2019.</p>

<p><b>Resource usage</b>: This release adds the <span
class="mono">qt.process_model</span> and <span
class="mono">qt.low_end_device_mode</span> settings which can be used to
decrease the resource usage of QtWebEngine (but come with other drawbacks).</p>

<p><b>Not trusting Google</b>: Various people have checked the connections made
by QtWebEngine/qutebrowser, and it doesn't make any connections to Google (or
any other unsolicited connections at all). Arguably, having to trust Google
also is a smaller issue than having to trust every website you visit because of
heaps of security issues...</p>

<p><b>Nouveau graphic driver</b>: You can use QtWebEngine with software
rendering. With Qt 5.13 (~May 2019) it might be possible to run with Nouveau
without software rendering.</p>

<p><b>Wayland</b>: It's possible to use QtWebEngine with XWayland. Some users
also seem to be able to run it natively with Qt 5.11, but currently, <span
class="mono">QUTE_SKIP_WAYLAND_CHECK=1</span> needs to be set in the
environment to do so.</p>

<p><b>Instability on FreeBSD</b>: Those seem to be FreeBSD-specific crashes,
and unfortunately nobody has looked into them yet so far...</p>

<p><b>QtWebEngine being unavailable in ArchlinuxARM's PyQt package</b>:
QtWebEngine itself is available on the armv7h/aarch64 architectures, but their
PyQt package is broken and doesn't come with QtWebEngine support. This
<a href="https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=11269&p=54587">has
been reported</a> in their forums, but without any change so far. It should
however be possible to rebuild the PyQt package from source with QtWebEngine
installed.</p>

<p><b>QtWebEngine being unavailable on Parabola</b>: Claims of Parabola
developers about QtWebEngine being "non-free" have repeatedly been disputed,
and so far nobody came up with solid evidence about that being the case. Also,
note that their qutebrowser package is orphaned and was often outdated in the
past (even qutebrowser security fixes took months to arrive there). You
might be better off chosing an <a
href="https://qutebrowser.org/doc/install.html">alternative install
method</a>.</p>

<p><b>White flashing between loads with a custom stylesheet</b>: This doesn't
seem to happen with <span class="mono">qt.process_model = single-process</span>
set. However, note that that setting comes with decreased security and
stability, but QtWebKit doesn't have any process isolation at all.</p>
