"""In qutebrowser, all keybindings are mapped to commands.

Some commands are hidden, which means they don't show up in the command
completion when pressing `:`, as they're typically not useful to run by hand.

For command arguments, there are also some variables you can use:

- `{url}` expands to the URL of the current page
- `{url:pretty}` expands to the URL in decoded format
- `{url:host}` expands to the host part of the URL
- `{clipboard}` expands to the clipboard contents
- `{primary}` expands to the primary selection contents

It is possible to run or bind multiple commands by separating them with `;;`.
"""
