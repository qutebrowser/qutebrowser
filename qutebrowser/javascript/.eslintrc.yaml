# qutebrowser's way of using eslint is perhaps a bit untypical: We turn on *all*
# the checks eslint has to offer, and then selectively disable/reconfigure the
# ones which got in the way below.
#
# This makes eslint much stricter (which is good). However, it means you might
# run into a case where you totally disagree with what it says, because some
# check is not useful or desired for qutebrowser, but nobody did run into it
# yet.
#
# In those cases, it's absolutely okay to modify this config as part of your PR.
# See it as a way to fine-tune eslint rather than a rigid style guide.
