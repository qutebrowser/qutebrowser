[[v2.5.0]]
v2.5.0 (unreleased)
-------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Improved message if a spawned process wasn't found and a Flatpak container is
  in use.
- The `:tab-move` command now takes `start` and `end` as `index` to move a tab
  to the first/last position.
- Tests now automatically pick the backend (QtWebKit/QtWebEngine) based on
  what's available. The `QUTE_BDD_WEBENGINE` environment variable and
  `--qute-bdd-webengine` argument got replaced by `QUTE_TESTS_BACKEND` and
  `--qute-backend` respectively, which can be set to either `webengine` or
  `webkit`.
- Using `:tab-give` or `:tab-take` on the last tab in a window now always
  closes that window, no matter what `tabs.last_close` is set to.
- Redesigned `qute://settings` (`:set`) page with buttons for options with
  fixed values.
- The default `hint.selectors` now match more ARIA roles (`tab`, `checkbox`,
  `menuitem`, `menuitemcheckbox` and `menuitemradio`).
- Using e.g. `:bind --mode=passthrough` now scrolls to the passthrough section
  on the `qute://bindings` page.
- Clicking on a notification now tries to focus the tab where the notification
  is coming from. Note this might not work properly if there is more than one
  tab from the same host open.
- The `qute-bitwarden` userscript understands a new
  `--password-prompt-invocation`, which can be used to specify a tool other
  than `rofi` to ask for a password.
- The `content.headers.custom` setting now accepts empty strings as values,
  resulting in an empty header being sent.
- Renamed settings:
  * `qt.low_end_device_mode` -> `qt.chromium.low_end_device_mode`
  * `qt.process_model` -> `qt.chromium.process_model`

Added
~~~~~

- New `input.match_counts` option which allows to turn off count matching for
  more emacs-like bindings.
- New `{relative_index}` field for `tabs.title.format` (and `.pinned_format`)
  which shows relative tab numbers.
- New `input.mode_override` option which allows overriding the current mode
  based on the new URL when navigating or switching tabs.

Fixed
~~~~~

- When `search.incremental` is disabled, searching using `/text` followed by a
  backwards search via `?text` (or vice-versa) now correctly changes the search
  direction.
- Elements getting a hint due to a `tabindex` now are skipped if it's set to
  `-1`, reducing some false-positives.
- The audible indicator (`[A]`) now uses a 2s cooldown when the audio goes
  silent, equivalent with the behavior of older QtWebEngine versions.
- With `confirm_quit` set to `downloads`, the confirmation dialog is now only
  shown when closing the last window (rather than closing any window, which
  would continue running that window's downloads). Unfortunately, more issues
  with `confirm_quit` and multiple windows remain.
- Crash when a previous crash-log file contains non-ASCII characters (which
  should never happen unless it was edited manually)
- Due to changes in Debian, an old workaround (for broken QtWebEngine patching
  on Debian) caused the inferior qutebrowser error page to be displayed, when
  Chromium's would have worked fine. The workaround was now dropped.
- Crash when using `<Ctrl-D>` (`:completion-item-del`) in the `:tab-focus`
  list, rather than `:tab-select`.

[[v2.4.1]]
v2.4.1 (unreleased)
-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Speculative fix for an immediate crash at start with the macOS/Windows
  binaries (in certain rare environments).
- Speculative fix for a qutebrowser crash when the notification daemon crashes
  while showing the notification.
- Fix crash when using `:screenshot` with an invalid `--rect` argument.
- Added a site-specific quirk to make cookie dialogs on StackExchange pages
  (such as Stack Overflow) work on Qt 5.12.

[[v2.4.0]]
v2.4.0 (2021-10-21)
-------------------

Security
~~~~~~~~

- **CVE-2021-41146**: Fix arbitrary command execution on Windows via URL handler
  argument injection. See the
  https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/security/advisories/GHSA-vw27-fwjf-5qxm[security advisory]
  for details.

Added
~~~~~

- New `content.blocking.hosts.block_subdomains` setting which can be used to
  disable the subdomain blocking for the hosts-based adblocker introduced in
  v2.3.0.
- New `downloads.prevent_mixed_content` setting to prevent insecure
  mixed-content downloads (true by default).
- New `--private` flag for `:tab-clone`, which clones a tab into a new private
  window, mirroring the same flags for `:open` and `:tab-give`.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Switching tabs via mouse wheel scrolling now works properly on macOS. Set
  `tabs.mousewheel_switching` to false if you prefer the previous behavior.
- Speculative fix for a crash when closing qutebrowser while a systray
  notification is shown.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Typing in the filename prompt now filters matching directories.
- When opening a file qutebrowser can't handle from a `file:///` directory
  listing, qutebrowser now opens it with the default application rather than
  displaying a download prompt.
- In Greasemonkey scripts, using "overrideMimeType" with GM_xmlhttpRequest is
  now supported.
- `:hint --rapid` is now supported for the `tab` hinting target no matter what
  `tabs.background` is set to, as there are various scenarios where tabs can
  open in the background.
- New flags for the `qute-pass` userscript:
  * `--unfiltered` to show all secrets, not just the one matching the current
    URL.
  * `--always-show-selection` to confirm the password to be entered even if
    there's only a single match.
- In insert mode, `<Shift-Escape>` is now bound to `fake-key <Escape>` by
  default, i.e., sends an Escape keypress to the website.
- Using `GM_setClipboard` in Greasemonkey scripts is now supported.

[[v2.3.1]]
v2.3.1 (2021-07-28)
-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Updated the workaround for Google Account log in claiming that this browser
  isn't secure. For an equivalent workaround on older versions, run:
  `:set -u https://accounts.google.com/* content.headers.user_agent "Mozilla/5.0 ({os_info}; rv:90.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/90.0"`
- Corrupt cache file exceptions with `adblock` 0.5.0+ are now handled properly.
- Crash when entering unicode surrogates into the filename prompt.
- `UnboundLocalError` in `qute-keepass` when the database couldn't be opened.

[[v2.3.0]]
v2.3.0 (2021-06-28)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- New `content.prefers_reduced_motion` setting to request websites to reduce
  non-essential motion/animations.
- New `colors.prompts.selected.fg` setting to customize the text color for
  selected items in filename prompts.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The hosts-based adblocker (using `content.blocking.hosts.lists`) now also
  blocks all requests to any subdomains of blocked hosts.
- The `fonts.web.*` settings now support URL patterns.
- The `:greasemonkey-reload` command now shows a list of loaded scripts and has
  a new `--quiet` switch to suppress that message.
- When launching a userscript via hints, a new `QUTE_CURRENT_URL` environment
  variable now points to the current page (rather than the URL of the selected
  element, where `QUTE_URL` points to).

Fixed
~~~~~

- Crash on macOS 10.14+ when logging into Google accounts -- the previous fix
  was incomplete due wrong information in Apple's documentation.
- Crash when two Greasemonkey scripts have the same name (usually happening
  because the same file is in both the data and the config directory).
- Deprecation warnings when using the `link_pyqt.py` script on Python 3.10
  (e.g. via `tox` or `mkvenv.py`).

[[v2.2.3]]
v2.2.3 (2021-06-01)
-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Logging into Google accounts or sharing the camera on macOS 10.14+ crashed,
  which is now fixed.
- The Windows installer now correctly aborts the installation on Windows 7
  (rather than attempting an install which won't work, since Windows 7 is
  unsupported since the v2.0.0 release).
- Using `--json-logging` without `--debug` caused qutebrowser to crash since the
  v1.13.0 release. It now works correctly again.
- Mixing Qt 5.14+ with QtWebEngine 5.12 caused a crash related to qutebrowser's
  notification support, which is now fixed.
- The documentation now points to the new IRC channels on irc.libera.chat
  instead of the defunct Freenode channels (due to a hostile takeover by
  Freenode staff).
- Setting `content.headers.user_agent` or `.accept_language` to a value
  containing non-ascii characters was permitted by qutebrowser, but resulted in
  a crash when loading a page. Such values are now rejected properly.
- When quitting qutebrowser on the `qute://settings` page, a crash could happen, which is now fixed.
- When `:edit-text` is used, but the existing text in the input isn't
  representable in the configured encoding (`editor.encoding`), qutebrowser would
  crash. It now shows a proper error instead.
- The testsuite should now work properly on aarch64.
- When QtWebEngine is in a "stuck" state while `:selection-follow` was used,
  this could cause a crash in qutebrowser. This is now fixed (speculatively, due
  to lack of a reproducer).
- When the brave adblock data (`adblock-cache.dat`) got corrupted, qutebrowser
  would crash when trying to load it. It now displays an error instead.
- Combining `/S` (silent) and `/allusers` when uninstalling via the Windows
  installer now works properly.

[[v2.2.2]]
v2.2.2 (2021-05-20)
-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- When awesomewm's "naughty" notification daemon was used with a development
  version of AwesomeWM and an unknown version number, qutebrowser would crash
  when trying to parse the version string. This is now fixed.
- Due to a bug with QtWebEngine 5.15.4, old Service Worker data could cause
  renderer process crashes. This is now worked around by qutebrowser.
- When an (broken) binding to `set-cmd-text` without any argument existed,
  using `:` would crash, which is now fixed.
- New site-specific quirk (again) working around not being able to type
  accented/composed characters on Google Docs.
- When running with `python -OO` (which is not recommended), a notification
  being shown would result in a crash, which is now fixed.

[[v2.2.1]]
v2.2.1 (2021-04-29)
-------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- When an error occurs in a notification presenter, qutebrowser now shows that
  error in the statusbar instead of just logging it.
- New site-specific-quirk for Discord logging users out when using vertical
  tabs (yes, really)

Fixed
~~~~~

- Certain errors from notification daemons are now displayed as non-fatal
  errors instead of qutebrowser crashing:
  * With the legacy GNOME Flashback notification daemon (not GNOME Shell), when
    more than 20 notifications are currently shown.
  * With the KDE Plasma notification daemon, when the same notification is
    shown twice (with <1s delay).
- The `mkvenv.py` script now works when `ldconfig -p` is failing.
- Running `:spawn -u -o` broke in v2.2.0 and now works properly again.
- Fixes in userscripts:
  * The `qute-bitwarden` userscript now still consumes returned data if the
    Bitwarden CLI showed a warning but exited with a 0 (successful) exit code.
  * The `qute-pass` userscript now doesn't try to match a username with
    `--password-only`, and error messages with invalid patterns are improved.
  * The `qute-pass` userscript now avoids running `pass` twice when `--otp-only`
    is used.

[[v2.2.0]]
v2.2.0 (2021-04-13)
-------------------

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- Running qutebrowser with Qt 5.12.0 is now unsupported and logs a warning. It
  should still work - however, a workaround for issues with the Nvidia graphic
  driver was dropped. Newer Qt 5.12.x versions are still fully supported.
- The `--force` argument for `:tab-only` is deprecated, use `--pinned close`
  instead.
- Using `:tab-focus` without an argument or count is now deprecated, use
  `:tab-next` instead.

Added
~~~~~

- New dependency on the `QtDBus` module. If this requirement is an issue for you
  or your distribution, please open an issue! Note that a DBus connection at
  runtime is still optional.
- New `input.media_keys` setting which can be used to disable Chromium's
  handling of media keys.
- New `:process` command (and associated `qute://process` pages) which can be
  used to view and terminate/kill external processes spawned by qutebrowser.
- New `content.site_specific_quirks.skip` setting which can be used to disable
  individual site-specific quirks.
- New `--pinned` argument for `:tab-only`, which replaces `--force` (with
  `--pinned close`), but also can take `--pinned keep` to keep pinned tabs
  without prompting.
- New `fileselect.folder.command` which can be used with
  `fileselect.handler = external` to customize the command to use to upload
  directories (`<input type="file" webkitdirectory />` elements, which are
  non-standard but in wide use).
- New `content.notifications.presenter` setting with various new ways to show
  web notifications:
     * `auto` (default): Automatically detect the best available option
     * `qt`: Use Qt's built-in mechanism (like before this release)
     * `libnotify`: Use a libnotify-compatible notification server (i.e. native
       notifications on Linux)
     * `systray`: Use a systray icon (very similar to `qt` but without some of
       its drawbacks)
     * `messages`: Use qutebrowser messages
     * `herbe`: Use https://github.com/dudik/herbe[herbe]
- New `content.notifications.show_origin` setting, which can be used to decide
  for which notifications to show the origin (the URL the notification was sent
  from).

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The `content.ssl_strict` setting got renamed to
  `content.tls.certificate_errors`, with new values:
  * `ask`: Prompt on overridable certificate errors (`ssl_strict = 'ask'`)
  * `ask-block-thirdparty`: See below
  * `block`: Block the page load (`ssl_strict = True`)
  * `load-insecurely`: Load the page despite the error (`ssl_strict = False`)
- The new `content.tls.certificate_errors` setting now also understands the
  value `ask-block-thirdparty`, which asks for page loads but automatically blocks
  resource loads on TLS errors. This behavior is consistent with what other
  browsers do.
- The prompt text shown on certificate errors has been improved to make it
  clearer what kind of error occurred exactly.
- The `content.site_specific_quirks` setting got renamed to
  `content.site_specific_quirks.enabled`.
- The `content.notifications` option got renamed to
  `content.notifications.enabled`.
- The completion now also shows bindings starting with `set-cmd-text` in its
  third column, such as `o` for `:open`.
- When `:spawn` is used with the `-m` / `--output-messages` flag, the output now
  appears live, while the process is running.
- When a shown message replaces an existing related one (e.g. for zoom levels),
  the replacing now also works even if a different message was shown in between.
- The `.redirect(...)` method on interceptors now supports an
  `ignore_unsupported=True` argument which supresses exceptions if a request could
  not be redirected. Note, however, that it is still not public API.
- When the `--config-py` argument is used, no warning about a missing
  `config.load_autoconfig` is shown anymore, as the argument is typically used
  for temporarily testing a config.
- The internal `_autosave` session used for crash recovery is now only saved
  once per minute, since saving it for every page load is a noticable performance
  issue.
- The `readability-js` userscript now displays a small header with page
  information.
- When an external file selector is used, some additional validation is done on
  the picked files now, so that errors are shown if e.g. a directory is selected
  when a file was expected.
- The default binding for `T` (`:tab-focus`) got changed so that it fills the
  command line with `:tab-focus` if used without a count (instead of being
  equivalent to `:tab-next` in that case).
- The `:config-unset` command now understands the `--pattern` (`-u`) flag to
  unset options customized for a given URL pattern (such as after answering a
  prompt with "always"/"never").
- The `:config-unset` command now shows an error when used on an option which is
  valid, but was never customized.
- The `statusbar.widgets` setting now understands `text:...` entries which
  allows adding a hard-coded text to the statusbar.
- The polyfill for `String.replaceAll` (required for Nextcloud Calendar < 2.2.0
  with QtWebEngine < 5.15.3) is now disabled by default, as it's not fully
  compliant to the ECMAScript spec and might cause issues on other websites.
  If you still need it (e.g. if you're still on an old Nextcloud Calendar
  version), remove `js-string-replaceall` from
  `content.site_specific_quirks.skip`.

Fixed
~~~~~

- When an editor exits with a != 0 exit status, the temporary editor file is now
  persisted. This already was the case when the editor crashed.
- When a nonexistent file gets passed to `--config-py`, qutebrowser now
  complains instead of silently not loading it.
- With some (rare) setups, opening the report dialog or using a PAC proxy with
  QtWebKit could result in qutebrowser hanging due to a PyQt bug. There's now a
  workaround which prevents the hang.
- QtWebEngine version detection (influencing things like dark mode settings or
  certain workarounds) now works correctly on OpenBSD.
- Certain version number formats in `/etc/os-release` caused qutebrowser to
  crash. Those are now handled correctly.
- The macOS releases now properly support Dark Mode for UI elements by setting
  `NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance` to false.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- The `qute://spawn-output` page used by `:spawn -o` is now removed, as it's
  replaced by the new `qute://process` pages.

[[v2.1.1]]
v2.1.1 (2021-04-01)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Site-specific quirk for krunker.io, which shows a "Socket Error" with
  qutebrowser's default Accept-Language header. The workaround is equivalent to
  doing `:set -u matchmaker.krunker.io content.headers.accept_language ""`.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Clicking the 'x' in the devtools window to hide it now also leaves insert
  mode.

Fixed
~~~~~

- The workaround for black on (almost) black formula images in dark mode now
  also works with Qt 5.12 and 5.13.
- When running in Flatpak or with the Windows/macOS releases, the QtWebEngine
  version is now detected properly. Before, a wrong version was assumed, breaking
  dark mode and certain workarounds (resulting in crashes on websites like
  LinkedIn or TradingView).
- When the metainfo in the completion database doesn't have the expected
  structure, qutebrowser now tries to gracefully recover from the situation
  instead of crashing.
- When qutebrowser displays an error during initialization, opening a second
  instance would lead to a crash. Instead, qutebrowser now ignores the attempt
  to open a new page as long as it's not fully initialized yet.
- When the Brave adblock cache folder was unreadable, qutebrowser crashed. It
  now displays an error instead.
- Fixes in the `qute-pass` userscript for `gopass`:
  * Generating OTP tokens now works correctly.
  * Storing the username as part of the secret broke in v2.0.0 and now works
    again.
- When using `bindings.key_mappings` to map a key to multiple other keys,
  qutebrowser would crash. This is now handled correctly - however, note that
  it's usually better to map keys to commands instead.
- When a minimized window is selected via `:tab-select`, it's now un-minimized
  properly.
- When a format string in the config (e.g. `tabs.title_format`) used a value
  like `{current_url.host}` (instead of `{current_url:host}`), qutebrowser
  would crash. It now correctly reports an invalid config value instead.
- In rare circumstances, sending URLs/commands to existing instances would
  result in a crash, which is now fixed.
- Running the testsuite should now fully work without internet access again.
- The `--asciidoc` script for `mkvenv.py` broke with v1.14.0. It now works
  correctly again.
- Various other fixes for running in Flatpak (backported in the Flatpak release
  even before this qutebrowser release).
- We are the Knights Who Say... ':Ni!'

[[v2.1.0]]
v2.1.0 (2021-03-12)
-------------------

Removed
~~~~~~~

- The following command aliases were deprecated in v2.0.0 and are now removed:
  * `run-macro` -> `macro-run`
  * `record-macro` -> `macro-record`
  * `buffer` -> `tab-select`
  * `open-editor` -> `edit-text`
  * `toggle-selection` -> `selection-toggle`
  * `drop-selection` -> `selection-drop`
  * `reverse-selection` -> `selection-reverse`
  * `follow-selected` -> `selection-follow`
  * `follow-hint` -> `hint-follow`
  * `enter-mode` -> `mode-enter`
  * `leave-mode` -> `mode-leave`

Added
~~~~~

- New `:screenshot` command which can be used to screenshot the visible part of
  the page.
- New optional dependency on the `importlib_metadata` project on Python 3.7 and
  below. This is only relevant when PyQtWebEngine is installed via pip - thus,
  this dependency usually isn't relevant for packagers.
- New `qute-keepassxc` userscript integrating with the KeePassXC browser API.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Initial support for QtWebEngine 5.15.3 and PyQt 5.15.3/.4
- The `colors.webpage.prefers_color_scheme_dark` setting got renamed to
  `colors.webpage.preferred_color_scheme` and now takes the values `auto`, `light`
  and `dark` (instead of being `True` for dark and `False` for auto).
  Note that the `light` value is only supported with Qt 5.15.2+, falling back to
  the same behavior as `auto` on older versions.
- On Linux, qutebrowser now tries harder to find details about the installed
  QtWebEngine version by inspecting the QtWebEngine binary. This should reduce
  issues with dark mode (and some workarounds) not working when using differing
  versions of QtWebEngine/PyQtWebEngine/Qt.
  This change also prepares qutebrowser for QtWebEngine 5.15.3, which will get
  released without an updated Qt.
- When PyQtWebEngine >= 5.15.3 is installed via `pip` (as is e.g. the case with
  `mkvenv.py`), qutebrowser now queries the associated metadata to find out the
  QtWebEngine version.
- When doing `:hint links yank --rapid`, the messages shown now replace each
  other, thus being less noisy.
- Newlines in JavaScript messages (`confirm`, `prompt` and `alert`) are now
  preserved.
- Messages in prompts are now word-wrapped rather than displaying them in one
  long line.
- If a command stats with space (e.g. `: open ...`, it's now not saved to
  command history anymore (similar to how some shells work).
- When a tab is pinned, running `:open` will now open a new tab instead of
  displaying an error.
- The `fileselect.*.command` settings now support file selectors writing the
  selected paths to stdout, which is used if no `{}` placeholder is contained in
  the configured command.
- The `--debug-flag` argument now understands a new `log-sensitive-keys` value
  which logs all keypresses (including those in insert/passthrough/prompt/...
  mode) for debugging.
- The `readability` and `readability-js` userscripts now add a
  `qute-readability` CSS class to the page, so that it can be styled easily via
  a user stylesheet.

Fixed
~~~~~

- With QtWebEngine 5.15.3 and some locales, Chromium can't start its
  subprocesses. As a result, qutebrowser only shows a blank page and logs
  "Network service crashed, restarting service.".  This release adds a
  `qt.workarounds.locale` setting working around the issue. It is disabled by
  default since distributions shipping 5.15.3 will probably have a proper patch
  for it backported very soon.
- The `colors.webpage.preferred_color_scheme` and `colors.webpage.darkmode.*`
  settings now work correctly with QtWebEngine 5.15.3 (and Gentoo, which at the
  time of writing packages 5.15.3 disguised as 5.15.2).
- When dark mode settings were set, existing `blink-features` arguments in
  `qt.args` (or `--qt-flag`) were overridden. They are now combined properly.
- On QtWebEngine 5.15.2, auto detection for the `prefers-color-scheme` media
  query is broken and always returns `no-preference`, which was removed from the
  CSS WG Specification. This release contains a workaround to always return
  `light` instead (as per the spec).
- When an external file selector deletes the temporary file (like `nnn` does
  when quitting the terminal), qutebrowser would crash. It now displays an
  error instead. The same applies if the temporary file is unreadable for any
  other reason.
- On macOS, a change in v2.0.x caused certain shortcuts to not work with Cmd
  anymore, using Ctrl instead. They now work correctly using Cmd (like usual on
  macOS) again.
- On macOS, using `F` (`hint all tab`) sometimes would open a context menu
  instead of following a link. This is now fixed.
- The quirk added for a missing `String.replaceAll` did not handle special
  regexp characters correctly, thus breaking some sites. It now handles them
  properly.
- The "try again" button on error pages now works correctly with JavaScript
  disabled.
- If a GreaseMonkey script doesn't have a "@run-at" comment, qutebrowser
  accidentally treated that as "@run-at document-idle". However, other
  GreaseMonkey implementations default to "@run-at document-end" instead, which
  is what qutebrowser now does, too.
- The `hist_importer.py` script didn't work correctly after qutebrowser v2.0.0
  and resulted in a history database qutebrowser couldn't read properly. It now
  works properly again.
- With certain QtWebEngine versions (5.15.0 based on Chromium 80 and 5.15.3
  based on Chromium 87), Chromium's dark mode doesn't invert certain SVG images,
  even with `colors.wegpage.darkmode.policy.images` set to `smart`.
  Most notably, this causes formulae on Wikipedia to display black on (almost)
  black. If `content.site_specific_quirks` is enabled, qutebrowser now injects
  some CSS as a workaround, which inverts all math formula images on Wikipedia
  (and potentially other sites, if they use the same CSS class).
- When a hint label text started with an apostrophe, it would show an escaped
  text until the hints first character has been pressed. It now shows up
  correctly.

[[v2.0.2]]
v2.0.2 (2021-02-04)
-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- When right-clicking an empty part of the downloads bar, qutebrowser v2.0.x
  would crash. This is now fixed.
- Setting `content.cookies.store` to `false` only worked properly when this was
  done after qutebrowser was already started due to a regression in v2.0.0. It now
  works as expected again.
- If qutebrowser was installed as a Python egg with Python 3.8 or 3.9,
  requesting unavailable resource files (such as PDF.js not being bundled, or a
  missing changelog file) caused in a crash due to an inconsistent behavior in
  those versions of Python. This is now handled properly by qutebrowser.
- In v2.0.0, support for importing the `sip` dependency as `sip` rather than
  `PyQt5.sip` was dropped, since upstream claims it should be used as `PyQt5.sip`
  ever since PyQt 5.11. However, some distributions still package sip as a global
  `sip` package. Thus, support for a global `sip` package is now reintroduced.
- The changelog for v2.0.0 claimed that `hints.leave_on_load` was set to `true`
  by default. However, the `input.insert_mode.leave_on_load` setting was instead
  set to `true` accidentally. This is now fixed by actually setting
  `hints.leave_on_load` to `true`, and reversing the change to
  `input.insert_mode.leave_on_load` so it is set to `false` by default again.
- When the `importlib_resources` package is required but was missing, users
  would get a Python stacktrace rather than a proper error message. This is now
  fixed.
- Site-specific quirk JavaScript files were loaded lazily rather than preloaded
  at the start of qutebrowser, causing a crash when e.g. switching between
  versions while qutebrowser is open. Now they are preloaded at the start of
  qutebrowser again.
- The link to the keybinding cheatsheet on the internal `:help` page wasn't
  displayed correctly. This is now fixed.
- When the completion rebuilding process was interrupted, qutebrowser did not
  detect this condition on the next start, thus resulting in a completion with
  inconsistent data. This is now fixed, with another rebuild being forced with
  this update, to ensure the data is consistent for all users.
- In certain scenarios, qutebrowser v2.0.x warned about
  `config.load_autoconfig(...)` being missing when loading a secondary config
  (e.g. via `config.source(...)`). It now only shows those warnings for the main
  `config.py` file.
- The `--enable-webengine-inspector` flag is now accepted again, however it's
  unused and undocumented. It purely exists to make it possible to use `:restart`
  between pre-v2.0.x and v2.0.2+ versions.
- When `hints.dictionary` pointed to a file not encoded as UTF-8, this resulted
  in a crash (also in versions before v2.0.0). It now properly displays an error
  instead.
- When running qutebrowser with a single empty commandline argument, such as
  done by `open_url_in_instance.sh`, this would result in a partially initialized
  window. Interacting with that window results in a crash (also in versions before
  v2.0.0). Instead, the startpage is now shown properly.

[[v2.0.1]]
v2.0.1 (2021-01-28)
-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- If qutebrowser was installed as a Python egg (similar to a .zip file, via
  `setup.py install` under certain conditions), a change in v2.0.0 caused it to
  not start properly. This is now fixed.
- If qutebrowser was set up (or packaged) in an unclean environment, this could
  result in a stale `qutebrowser/components/adblock.py` file being picked up. That
  file is not part of the release anymore, but if an old version is still around,
  causes qutebrowser to crash. It's now explicitly blocked inside qutebrowser so
  it gets ignored even if it still exists.
- When the adblocking method was switched using `:set`, and the `adblock`
  dependency was unavailable when qutebrowser started (but was installed while
  qutebrowser was open), this resulted in a crash. Now a warning prompting for a
  restart of qutebrowser is shown instead.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The `format_json` userscript now uses sh instead of bash again.
- The `add-nextcloud-bookmarks`, `add-nextcloud-cookbook`, `readability` and
  `ripbang` userscripts now use a `python3` rather than plain `python` shebang.
- When `QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS` is set in the environment, this causes flag
  handling (including workarounds for QtWebEngine crashes) inside qutebrowser to
  break. This will be handled properly in a future version, but this release now
  shows a warning on standard output if this is the case.
- The config completion for `fileselect.*.command` now also includes the "nnn"
  terminal file manager.

[[v2.0.0]]
v2.0.0 (2021-01-28)
-------------------

Major changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If the Python `adblock` library is available, it is now used to
  integrate Brave's Rust adblocker library for improved adblocking based on
  ABP-like filter lists (such as EasyList).
  If it is unavailable, qutebrowser falls back to host-blocking, i.e. the same
  blocking technique it used before this release. As part of this, various
  settings got renamed, see "Changed" below.
  **Note: If the `adblock` dependency is available, qutebrowser will ignore
  custom host blocking** via the `blocked-hosts` config file or `file:///` URLs
  supplied as host blocking lists. You will need to either migrate those to
  ABP-like lists, or set `content.blocking.method` to `both`.
- Various dependency upgrades - a quick checklist for packagers (see "Changed"
  below for details):
  * Ensure you're providing at least Python 3.6.1.
  * Ensure you're providing at least Qt 5.12 and PyQt 5.12.
  * Add a new optional dependency on the Python `adblock` library (if packaged -
    if not, consider packaging it, albeit optional it's very useful for users).
  * Remove the `cssutils` optional dependency (if present).
  * Remove the `attrs` (`attr`) dependency.
  * Remove the `pypeg2` dependency (and perhaps consider dropping the package
    if not used elsewhere - it's https://fdik.org/pyPEG2/[inactive upstream]
    and the repository was removed by Bitbucket).
  * Move the `pygments` dependency from required to optional.
  * Move the `setuptools` dependency from runtime (for `pkg_resources`) to
    build-time.
  * For Python 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8, add a dependency on the `importlib_resources`
    backport.
  * For Python 3.6 only, add a dependency on the `dataclasses` backport.
- Dropped support for old OS versions in binary releases:
  * Support for Windows 7 is dropped in the Windows binaries, the minimum
    required Windows version is now Windows 8.1.
  * Support for macOS 10.13 High Sierra is dropped in the macOS binaries, the
    minimum required macOS version is now macOS 10.14 Mojave.
- Various renamed settings and commands, see "Deprecated" and "Changed" below.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- The `--enable-webengine-inspector` flag (which was only needed for Qt 5.10 and
  below) is now dropped. With Qt 5.11 and newer, the inspector/devtools are
  enabled unconditionally.
- Support for moving qutebrowser data from versions before v1.0.0 has been
  removed.
- The `--old` flag for `:config-diff` has been removed. It used to show
  customized options for the old pre-v1.0 config files (in order to aid
  migration to v1.0).
- The `:inspector` command which was deprecated in v1.13.0 (in favor of
  `:devtools`) is now removed.

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- Several commands have been renamed for consistency and/or easier grouping of
  related commands. Their old names are still available, but deprecated and will
  be removed in qutebrowser v2.1.0.
  * `run-macro` -> `macro-run`
  * `record-macro` -> `macro-record`
  * `buffer` -> `tab-select`
  * `open-editor` -> `edit-text`
  * `toggle-selection` -> `selection-toggle`
  * `drop-selection` -> `selection-drop`
  * `reverse-selection` -> `selection-reverse`
  * `follow-selected` -> `selection-follow`
  * `follow-hint` -> `hint-follow`
  * `enter-mode` -> `mode-enter`
  * `leave-mode` -> `mode-leave`

Added
~~~~~

- New settings for the ABP-based adblocker:
   * `content.blocking.method` to decide which blocker(s) should be used.
   * `content.blocking.adblock.lists` to configure ABP-like lists to use.
- New `qt.environ` setting which makes it easier to set/unset environment
  variables for qutebrowser.
- New settings to use an external file picker (such as ranger or vifm):
  * `fileselect.handler` (`default` or `external`)
  * `fileselect.multiple_files.command`
  * `fileselect.single_file.command`
- When QtWebEngine has been updated but PyQtWebEngine hasn't yet, the dark mode
  settings might stop working. As a (currently undocumented) escape hatch, this
  version adds a `QUTE_DARKMODE_VARIANT=qt_515_2` environment variable which can
  be set to get the correct behavior in (transitive) situations like this.
- New `--desktop-file-name` commandline argument, which can be used to customize
  the desktop filename passed to Qt (which is used to set the `app_id` on
  Wayland).
- The `:open` completion now also completes local file paths and `file://` URLs,
  via a new `filesystem` entry in `completion.open_categories`. Also, a new
  `completion.favorite_paths` setting was added which can be used to add paths to
  show when `:open` is used without any input.
- New `QUTE_VERSION` variable for userscripts, which can be used to read
  qutebrowser's version.
- New "Copy URL" entry in the context menu for downloads.
- New `:bookmark-list` command which lists all bookmarks/quickmarks. The
  corresponding `qute://bookmarks` URL already existed since v0.8.0, but it was
  never exposed as a command.
- New `qt.workarounds.remove_service_workers` setting which can be used to
  remove the "Service Workers" directory on every start. Usage of this option is
  generally discouraged, except in situations where the underlying QtWebEngine bug
  is a known cause for crashes.
- Changelogs are now shown after qutebrowser was upgraded. By default, the
  changelog is only shown after minor upgrades (feature releases) but not patch
  releases. This can be adjusted (or disabled entirely) via a new
  `changelog_after_upgrade` setting.
- New userscripts:
  * `kodi` to play videos in Kodi
  * `qr` to generate a QR code of the current URL
  * `add-nextcloud-bookmarks` to create bookmarks in Nextcloud's Bookmarks app
  * `add-nextcloud-cookbook` to add recipes to Nextcloud's Cookbook app

Changed
~~~~~~~

- `config.py` files now are required to have either
  `config.load_autoconfig(False)` (don't load `autoconfig.yml`) or
  `config.load_autoconfig()` (do load `autoconfig.yml`) in them.
- Various host-blocking settings have been renamed to accomodate the new ABP-like
  adblocker:
  * `content.host_blocking.enabled` -> `content.blocking.enabled` (controlling both blockers)
  * `content.host_blocking.whitelist` -> `content.blocking.whitelist` (controlling both blockers)
  * `content.host_blocking.lists` -> `content.blocking.hosts.lists`
- Changes to default settings:
  * `tabs.background` is now `true` by default, so that new tabs get opened in the
    background.
  * `input.partial_timeout` is now set to 0 by default, so that partially typed
    key strings are never cleared.
  * `hints.leave_on_load` is now `false` by default, so that hint mode doesn't get
    left when a page finishes loading. This can lead to stale hints persisting in
    rare circumstances, but is better than leaving hint mode when the user entered
    it before loading was completed.
  * The default for `tabs.width` (tab bar width if vertical) is now 15% of the
    window width rather than 20%.
  * The default bindings for moving tabs (`tab-move -` and `tab-move +`) were
    changed from `gl` and `gr` to `gK` and `gJ`, to be consistent with the tab
    switching bindings.
  * The text color for warning messages is now black instead of white, for increased contrast and thus readability.
  * The default timeout for messages is now raised from 2s to 3s.
- On the first start, the history completion database is regenerated to remove
  a few problematic entries (such as long `qute://pdfjs` URLs). This might take
  a couple of minutes, but is a one-time operation. This should result in a
  performance improvement for the completion for affected users.
- qutebrowser now shows an error if its history database version is newer than
  expected. This currently should never happen, but allows for potentially
  backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.
- At least Python 3.6.1 is now required to run qutebrowser, support for Python
  3.5 (and 3.6.0) is dropped. Note that Python 3.5 is
  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3510/[no longer supported
  upstream] since September 2020.
- At least Qt/PyQt 5.12 is now required to run qutebrowser, support for 5.7 to
  5.11 (inclusive) is dropped. While Debian Buster ships Qt 5.11, it's based on a
  Chromium version from 2018 with
  https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#browser-security[no Debian security support]
  and unsupported upstream since May 2019.
  It also has compatibility issues with various websites (GitHub, Twitch, Android
  Developer documentation, YouTube, ...). Since no newer Debian Stable is released
  at the time of writing, it's recommended to
  https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/install.asciidoc#installing-qutebrowser-with-virtualenv[install qutebrowser in a virtualenv]
  with a newer version of Qt/PyQt.
- New optional dependency on the Python `adblock` library (see above for details).
- The (formerly optional) `cssutils` dependency is now removed. It was only
  needed for improved behavior in corner cases when using `:download --mhtml`
  with the (non-default) QtWebKit backend, and as such it's unlikely anyone is
  still relying on it. The `cssutils` project is also dead upstream, with its
  repository being gone after Bitbucket
  https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket[removed Mercurial support].
- The (formerly required) `pygments` dependency is now optional. It is only
  used when using `:view-source` with QtWebKit, or when forcing it via
  `:view-source --pygments` on QtWebEngine. If it is unavailable, an
  unhighlighted fallback version of the page's source is shown.
- The former runtime dependency on the `pkg_resources` module (part of the
  `setuptools` project) got dropped. Note that `setuptools` is still required
  to run `setup.py`.
- A new dependency on the `importlib_resources` module got introduced for
  Python versions up to and including 3.8. Note that the stdlib
  `importlib.resources` module for Python 3.7 and 3.8 is missing the needed APIs,
  thus requiring the backports for those versions as well.
- The former dependency on the `attrs`/`attr` package is now dropped in favour
  of `dataclasses` in the Python standard library. On Python 3.6, a new
  dependency on the `dataclasses` backport is now required.
- The former dependency on the `pypeg2` package is now dropped. This might cause
  some changes for certain corner-cases for suggested filenames when downloading
  files with the QtWebKit backend.
- Windows and macOS releases now ship Python 3.9 rather than 3.7.
- The `colors.webpage.darkmode.*` settings are now also supported with older Qt
  versions (Qt 5.12 and 5.13) rather than just with Qt 5.14 and above.
- For regexes in the config (`hints.{prev,next}_regexes`), certain patterns
  which will change meanings in future Python versions are now disallowed. This is
  the case for character sets starting with a literal `[` or containing literal
  character sequences `--`, `&&`, `~~`, or `||`. To avoid a warning, remove the
  duplicate characters or escape them with a backslash.
- If `prompt(..., "default")` is used via JS, the default text is now
  pre-selected in the prompt shown by qutebrowser.
- URLs such as `::1/foo` are now handled as a search term or local file rather
  than IPv6. Use `[::1]/foo` to force parsing as IPv6 instead.
- The `mkvenv.py` script now runs a "smoke test" after setting up the virtual
  environment to ensure it's working as expected. If necessary, the test can be
  skipped via a new `--skip-smoke-test` flag.
- Both qutebrowser userscripts and Greasemonkey scripts are now additionally
  picked up from qutebrowser's config directory (the `userscripts` and
  `greasemonkey` subdirectories of e.g. `~/.config/qutebrowser/`) rather than only
  the data directory (the same subdirectories of e.g.
  `~/.local/share/qutebrowser/`).
- The `:later` command now understands a time specification like `5m` or
  `1h5m2s`, rather than just taking milliseconds.
- The `importer.py` script doesn't use a browser argument anymore; instead its
  `--input-format` switch can be used to configure the input format. The help also
  was expanded to explain how to use it properly.
- If `tabs.tabs_are_windows` is set, the `tabs.last_close` setting is now
  ignored and the window is always closed when using `:close` (`d`).
- With the (default) QtWebEngine backend, if a custom `accept` header is set via
  `content.headers.custom`, the custom value is now ignored for XHR
  (`XMLHttpRequest`) requests. Instead, the sent value is now `*/*` or the header
  set from JavaScript, as it would be if `content.headers.custom` wasn't set.
- The `:tab-select` completion now shows the underlying renderer process PID if
  doing so is supported (on QtWebEngine 5.15).
- If `tabs.favicons.show` is set to `never`, favicons aren't unnecessarily
  downloaded anymore. Thus, disabling favicons can help with a possible
  https://www.ghacks.net/2021/01/22/favicons-may-be-used-to-track-users/[fingerprinting vector].
- "Super" is now understood as a modifier (i.e. as alias to "Meta").
- Initial support for Python 3.10 (currently in Alpha stage).
- Various performance improvements, including for the startup time.

Fixed
~~~~~

- With interpolated color settings (`colors.tabs.indicator.*` and
  `colors.downloads.*`), the alpha channel is now handled correctly.
- Fixes to userscripts:
    * `format_json` now uses `env` in its shebang, making it work
      correctly on systems where `bash` isn't located in `/bin`.
    * `qute-pass` now handles the MIME output format introduced in gopass 1.10.0.
    * `qute-lastpass` now types multiple `<` or `>` characters correctly.
- The `:undo` completion now sorts its entries correctly (by the numerical index
  rather than lexicographically).
- The `completion.web_history.ignore` setting now works properly when set in
  `config.py` (rather than via `:set`). Additionally, a `:config-source` will not
  result in a history rebuild if the value wasn't actually changed.
- When downloading a `data:` URL, the suggested filename is now improved and
  contains a proper extension. Before this fix, qutebrowser would use the URL's
  data contents as filename with QtWebEngine; or "binary blob" with the Qt network
  stack.
- When `:tab-only` is run before a tab is available, an error is now shown
  instead of crashing.
- A couple of long URLs (such as `qute://pdfjs` URLs) are now not added to the
  history database anymore.
- A bug in QtWebEngine 5.15.2 causes "renderer process killed" errors on
  websites like LinkedIn and TradingView. There is now a workaround in qutebrowser
  to prevent this from happening.
- Nextcloud Calendars started using `String.replaceAll` which was only added to
  Chromium recently (Chrome 85), so won't work with current QtWebEngine
  versions. This release includes a workaround (a polyfill as a
  site-specific-quirk).

[[v1.14.1]]
v1.14.1 (2020-12-04)
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

- With v1.14.0, qutebrowser configures the main window to be transparent, so
  that it's possible to configure a translucent tab- or statusbar. However, that
  change introduced various issues, such as performance degradation on some
  systems or breaking dmenu window embedding with its `-w` option. To avoid those
  issues for people who are not using transparency, the default behavior is
  reverted to versions before v1.14.0 in this release. A new `window.transparent`
  setting can be set to `true` to restore the behavior of v1.14.0.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Windows and macOS releases now ship Qt 5.15.2, which is based on
  Chromium 83.0.4103.122 with security fixes up to 86.0.4240.183. This includes
  CVE-2020-15999 in the bundled freetype library, which is known to be exploited
  in the wild. It also includes various other bugfixes/features compared to
  Qt 5.15.0 included in qutebrowser v1.14.0, such as:
    * Correct handling of AltGr on Windows
    * Fix for `content.cookies.accept` not working properly
    * Fixes for screen sharing (some websites are still broken until an upcoming Qt
      5.15.3)
    * Support for FIDO U2F / WebAuth
    * Fix for the unwanted creation of directories such as `databases-incognito` in
      the home directory
    * Proper autocompletion in the devtools console
    * Proper signalisation of a tab's audible status (`[A]`)
    * Fix for a hang when opening the context menu on macOS Big Sur (11.0)
    * Hardware accelerated graphics on macOS

Fixed
~~~~~

- Setting the `content.headers.referer` setting to `same-domain` (the default)
  was supposed to truncate referers to only the host with QtWebEngine.
  Unfortunately, this functionality broke in Qt 5.14. It works properly again
  with this release, including a test so this won't happen again.
- With QtWebEngine 5.15, setting the `content.headers.referer` setting to
  `never` did still send referers. This is now fixed as well.
- In v1.14.0, a regression was introduced, causing a crash when qutebrowser was
  closed after opening a download with PDF.js. This is now fixed.
- With Qt 5.12, the `Object.fromEntries` JavaScript API is unavailable (it was
  introduced in Chromium 73, while Qt 5.12 is based on 69). This caused
  https://www.vr.fi/en and possibly other websites to break when accessed with Qt
  5.12. A suitable polyfill is now included with qutebrowser if
  `content.site_specific_quirks` is enabled (which is the default).
- While XDG startup notifications (e.g. launch feedback via the bouncy cursor
  in KDE Plasma) were supported ever since Qt 5.1, qutebrowser's desktop file
  accidentally declared that it wasn't supported. This is now fixed.
- The `dmenu_qutebrowser` and `qutedmenu` userscripts now correctly read the
  qutebrowser sqlite history which has been in use since v1.0.0.
- With Python 3.8+ and vertical tabs, a deprecation warning for an implicit int
  conversion was shown. This is now fixed.
- Ever since Qt 5.11, fetching more completion data when that data is loaded
  lazily (such as with history) and the last visible item is selected was broken.
  The exact reason is currently unknown, but this release adds a tenative fix.
- When PgUp/PgDown were used to go beyond the last visible item, the above issue
  caused a crash, which is now also fixed.
- As a workaround for an overzealous Microsoft Defender false-positive detecting
  a "trojan" in the (unprocessed) adblock list, `:adblock-update` now doesn't
  cache the HTTP response anymore.
- With the QtWebKit backend and `content.headers` set to `same-domain` (the
  default), origins with the same domain but different schemes or ports were
  treated as the same domain. They now are correctly treated as different domains.
- When a URL path uses percent escapes (such as
  `https://example.com/embedded%2Fpath`), using `:navigate up` would treat the
  `%2F` as a path separator and replace any remaining percent escapes by their
  unescaped equivalents. Those are now handled correctly.
- On macOS 11.0 (Big Sur), the default monospace font name caused a parsing error, thus
  resulting in broken styling for the completion, hints, and other UI components.
  They now look properly again.
- Due to a Qt bug, installing Qt/PyQt from prebuilt binaries on systems with a
  very old `libxcb-utils` version (notably, Debian Stable, but not Ubuntu since
  16.04 LTS) results in a setup which fails to start. This also affects the
  `mkvenv.py` script, which now includes a workaround for this case.
- The `open_url_instance.sh` userscript now complains when `socat` is not
  installed, rather than silencing the error.
- The example AppArmor profile in `misc/` was outdated and written for the
  older QtWebKit backend. It is now updated to serve as an useful starting
  point with QtWebEngine.
- When running `:devtools` on Fedora without the needed (optional) dependency
  installed, it was suggested to install `qt5-webengine-devtools`, which does
  not, in fact, exist. It's now correctly suggested to install
  `qt5-qtwebengine-devtools` instead.
- With Qt 5.15.2, lines/borders coming from the  `readability-js` userscript
  were invisible. This is now fixed by changing the border color to grey (with all
  Qt versions).
- Due to changes in the underlying Chromium, the
  `colors.webpage.prefers_color_scheme_dark` setting broke with Qt 5.15.2. It now
  works properly again.
- A bug in the `pkg_resources` module used by qutebrowser caused deprecation
  warnings to appear on start with Python 3.9 on some setups. Those are now
  hidden.
- Minor performance improvements.
- Fix for various functionality breaking in private windows with v1.14.0,
  after the last private window is closed. This includes:
    * Ad blocking
    * Downloads
    * Site-specific quirks (e.g. for Google login)
    * Certain settings such as `content.javascript.enabled`

[[v1.14.0]]
v1.14.0 (2020-10-15)
--------------------

Note: The QtWebEngine version bundled with the Windows/macOS
releases is still based on Qt 5.15.0 (like with qutebrowser v1.12.0 and
v1.13.0) rather than Qt 5.15.1 because of a
https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-86752[Qt bug] causing
frequent renderer process crashes. When Qt 5.15.2 is released
(planned for November 3rd, 2020), a qutebrowser v1.14.x patch
release with an updated QtWebEngine will be released.

Furthermore, this release still only contains partial session support for QtWebEngine
5.15. It's still recommended to run against Qt 5.15 due to the security patches
contained in it -- for most users, the added workarounds seem to work out fine. A
rewritten session support will be part of qutebrowser v2.0.0, tentatively planned for the
end of the year or early 2021.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The `content.media_capture` setting got split up into three more fine-grained
  settings, `content.media.audio_capture`, `.video_capture` and
  `.audio_video_capture`. Before this change, answering "always" to a prompt
  about e.g. audio capturing would set the `content.media_capture` setting,
  which would also allow the same website to capture video on a future visit.
  Now every prompt will set the appropriate setting, though existing
  `content.media_capture` settings in `autoconfig.yml` will be migrated to set
  all three settings. To review/change previously granted permissions, use
  `:config-diff` and e.g.
  `:config-unset -u example.org content.media.video_capture`.
- The main window's (invisible) background color is now set to transparent.
  This allows using the alpha channel in statusbar/tabbar colors to get a
  partially transparent qutebrowser window on a setup which supports doing so.
- If QtWebEngine is compiled with PipeWire support and libpipewire is
  installed, qutebrowser will now support screen sharing on Wayland. Note that
  QtWebEngine 5.15.1 is needed.
- When `:undo` is used with a count, it now reopens the count-th to last tab
  instead of the last one. The depth can instead be passed as an argument,
  which is also completed.
- The default `completion.timestamp_format` now also shows the time.
- `:back` and `:forward` now take an optional index which is completed using
  the current tab's history.
- The time a website in a tab was visited is now saved/restored in sessions.
- When attempting to download a file to a location for which there's already a
  still-running download, a confirmation prompt is now displayed.
- `:completion-item-focus` now understands `next-page` and `prev-page` with
  corresponding `<PgDown>` / `<PgUp>` default bindings.
- When the last private window is closed, all private browsing data is now cleared.
- When `config.source(...)` is used with a `--config-py` argument given,
  qutebrowser used to search relative files in the config basedir, leading to them
  not being found when using a shared `config.py` for different basedirs. Instead,
  they are now searched relative to the given `config.py` file.
- `navigate prev` (`[[`) and `navigate next` (`]]`) now recognize links with
  `nav-prev` and `nav-next` classes, such as those used by the Hugo static site
  generator.
- When `tabs.favicons` is disabled but `tabs.tabs_are_windows` is set, the
  window icon is still set to the page's favicon now.
- The `--asciidoc` argument to `src2asciidoc.py` and `build_release.py` now
  only takes the path to `asciidoc.py`, using the current Python interpreter by
  default. To configure the Python interpreter as well, use
  `--asciidoc-python path/to/python --asciidoc path/to/asciidoc.py`
  instead of the former
  `--asciidoc path/to/python path/to/asciidoc.py`.
- Dark mode (`colors.webpage.darkmode.*`) is now supported with Qt 5.15.2 (which
  is not released yet).
- The default for the darkmode `policy.images` setting is now set to `smart`
  which fixes issues with e.g. formulas on Wikipedia.
- The `readability-js` userscript now adds some CSS to improve the reader mode
  styling in various scenarios:
  * Images are now shrinked to the page width, similarly to what Firefox' reader
    mode does.
  * Some images ore now displayed as block (rather than inline) which is what
    Firefox' reader mode does as well.
  * Blockquotes are now styled more distinctively, again based on the Firefox
    reader mode.
  * Code blocks are now easier to distinguish from text and tables have visible
    cell margins.
- The `readability-js` userscript now supports hint userscript mode.

Added
~~~~~

- New argument `strip` for `:navigate` which removes queries and
  fragments from the current URL.
- `:undo` now has a new `-w` / `--window` argument, which can be used to
  restore closed windows (rather than tabs). This is bound to `U` by default.
- `:jseval` can now take `javascript:...` URLs via a new `--url` flag.
- New replacement `{aligned_index}` for `tabs.title.format` and `format_pinned`
  which behaves like `{index}`, but space-pads the index based on the total
  numbers of tabs. This can be used to get aligned tab texts with vertical
  tabs.
- New command `:devtools-focus` (bound to `wIf`) to toggle keyboard focus
  between the devtools and web page.
- The `--target` argument to qutebrowser now understands a new `private-window`
  value, which can be used to open a private window in an existing instance
  from the commandline.
- The `:download-open` command now has a new `--dir` flag, which can be used to
  open the directory containing the downloaded file. An entry to do the same
  was also added to the context menu.
- Messages are now wrapped when they are too long to be displayed on a single line.
- New possible `--debug-flag` values:
  * `wait-renderer-process` waits for a `SIGUSR1` in the renderer process so a
    debugger can be attached.
  * `avoid-chromium-init` allows using `--version` without needing a working
    QtWebEngine/Chromium.

Fixed
~~~~~

- A URL pattern with a `*.` host was considered valid and matched all hosts.
  Due to keybindings like `tsH` toggling scripts for `*://*.{url:host}/*`,
  invoking them on pages without a host (e.g. `about:blank`) could result in
  accidentally allowing/blocking JavaScript for all pages. Such patterns are
  now considered invalid, with existing patterns being automatically removed
  from `autoconfig.yml`.
- When `scrolling.bar` was set to `overlay` (the default), qutebrowser would
  internally override any `enable-features=...` flags passed via `qt.args` or
  `--qt-flag`. It now correctly combines existing `enable-feature` flags with
  internal ones.
- Elements with an inherited `contenteditable` attribute now trigger insert
  mode and get hints assigned correctly.
- When checkmarks, radio buttons and some other elements are styled via the
  Bootstrap CSS framework, they now get hints correctly.
- When the session file isn't writable when qutebrowser exits, an error is now
  logged instead of crashing.
- When using `-m` with the `qute-lastpass` userscript, it accidentally matched
  URLs containing the match as substring. This is now fixed.
- When a filename is derived from a page's title, it's now shortened to the
  maximum filename length permitted by the filesystem.
- `:enter-mode register` crashed since v1.13.0, it now displays an error
  instead.
- With the QtWebKit backend, webpage resources loading certain invalid URLs
  could cause a crash, which is now fixed.
- When `:config-edit` is used but no `config.py` exists yet, the file is now
  created (and watched for changes properly) before spawning the external
  editor.
- When hint mode was entered from outside normal mode, the status bar was empty
  instead of displaying the proper text. This is now fixed.
- When entering different modes too quickly (e.g. pressing `fV`), the statusbar
  could end up in a confusing state. This is now fixed.
- When qutebrowser quits, running downloads are now cancelled properly.
- The site-specific quirk for `web.whatsapp.com` has been updated to work after recent
  changes in WhatsApp.
- Highlighting in the completion now works properly when UTF-16 surrogate pairs (such as
  emoji) are involved.
- When a windowed inspector is clicked, insert mode now isn't entered anymore.
- When `:undo` is used to re-open a tab, but `tabs.tabs_are_windows` was set between
  closing and undoing the close, qutebrowser crashed. This is now fixed.
- With QtWebEngine 5.15.0, setting the darkmode image policy to `smart` leads to
  renderer process crashes. The offending setting value is now ignored with a
  warning.
- Fixes for the `qute-pass` userscript:
  * With newer `gopass` versions, a deprecation notice was copied as
    password due to `qute-pass` using it in a deprecated way.
  * The `--password-store` argument didn't actually set
    `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR` for `pass`, resulting in `qute-pass` finding matches but the
    underlying `pass` not finding matching passwords.

[[v1.13.1]]
v1.13.1 (2020-07-17)
--------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- With Qt 5.14, shared workers are now disabled. This works around a crash in
  QtWebEngine on certain sites (like the Epic Games Store or the Unreal Engine
  page). On older versions, you can get the same effect by doing
  `:set qt.args "['disable-shared-workers']"` and `:restart` (or set the
  setting in your `config.py`).
- When a window is closed, the tab it contains are now correctly shut down
  (closing e.g. any dialogs which are still open for those tabs).
- The Qt 5.15 session workaround now loads the correct (rather than the last)
  page when `:back` was used before saving a session.
- In certain situations on Windows, qutebrowser fails to find the username of
  the user launching qutebrowser (most likely due to a bug in the application
  launching it). When this happens, an error is now displayed instead of
  crashing.
- Certain `autoconfig.yml` with an invalid structure could lead to crashes,
  which are now fixed.
- Generating docs with `asciidoc2html.py` (e.g. via `mkvenv.py`) now works
  correctly without Pygments being installed system-wide.
- Ever since Qt 5.9, when `input.mouse.rocker_gestures` was enabled, the
  context menu still was shown when clicking the right mouse button, thus
  preventing the rocker gestures. This is now fixed.
- Clicking the inspector switched from existing modes (such as passthrough) to
  normal mode since v1.13.0. Now insert mode is only entered when the inspector
  is clicked in normal mode.
- Pulseaudio now shows qutebrowser's audio streams as qutebrowser correctly,
  rather than showing them as Chromium with some Qt versions.
- If `:help` was called with a deprecated command (e.g. `:help :inspector`),
  the help page would show despite deprecated commands not being documented.
  This now shows an error instead.
- The `qute-lastpass` userscript now filters out duplicate entries with
  `--merge-candidates`.

[[v1.13.0]]
v1.13.0 (2020-06-26)
--------------------

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- The `:inspector` command is deprecated and has been replaced by a new
  `:devtools` command (see below).

Removed
~~~~~~~

- The `:debug-log-level` command was removed as it's replaced by the new
  `logging.level.console` setting.
- The `qute://plainlog` special page got replaced by `qute://log?plain` - the
  names of those pages is considered an implementation detail, and
  `:messages --plain` should be used instead.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Changes to commands:
  * `:config-write-py` now adds a note about `config.py` files being targeted at
    advanced users.
  * `:report` now takes two optional arguments for bug/contact information, so
    that it can be used without the report window popping up.
  * `:message` now takes a `--logfilter` / `-f` argument, which is a list of
    logging categories to show.
  * `:debug-log-filter` now understands the full logfilter syntax.
- Changes to settings:
  * `fonts.tabs` has been split into `fonts.tabs.{selected,unselected}` (see
    below).
  * `statusbar.hide` has been renamed to `statusbar.show` with the possible
    values being `always` (`hide = False`), `never` (`hide = True`) or
    `in-mode` (new, only show statusbar outside of normal mode.
  * The `QtFont` config type formerly used for `fonts.tabs` and
    `fonts.debug_console` is now removed and entirely replaced by `Font`. The
    former distinction was mainly an implementation detail, and the accepted
    values shouldn't have changed.
  * `input.rocker_gestures` has been renamed to `input.mouse.rocker_gestures`.
  * `content.dns_prefetch` is now enabled by default again, since the crashes
    it caused are now fixed (Qt 5.15) or worked around.
  * `scrolling.bar` supports a new `overlay` value to show an overlay
    scrollbar, which is now the default. On unsupported configurations (on Qt <
    5.11, with QtWebKit or on macOS), the value falls back to `when-searching`
    or `never` (QtWebKit).
  * `url.auto_search` supports a new `schemeless` value which always opens a
    search unless the given URL includes an explicit scheme.
- New handling of bindings in hint mode which fixes various bugs and allows for
  single-letter keybindings in hint mode.
- The statusbar now shows partial keychains in all modes (e.g. while hinting).
- New `t[Cc][Hh]` default bindings which work similarly to the `t[Ss][Hh]`
  bindings for JavaScript but toggle cookie permissions.
- The `tor_identity` userscript now takes the password via a `-p` flag and has
  a new `-c` flag to customize the Tor control port.
- Small performance improvements.

Added
~~~~~

- New settings:
  * `logging.level.ram` and `logging.level.console` to configure the default
    logging levels via the config.
  * `fonts.tabs.selected` and `fonts.tabs.unselected` to set the font of the
    selected tab independently from unselected tabs (e.g. to make it bold).
  * `input.mouse.back_forward_buttons` which can be set to `false` to disable
    back/forward mouse buttons.
- New `:devtools` command (replacing `:inspector`) with various improved
  functionality:
  * The devtools can now be docked to the main window, by running
    `:devtools left` (`wIh`), `bottom` (`wIj`), `top` (`wIk`) or `right`
    (`wIl`). To show them in a new window, use `:devtools window` (`wIw`).
    Using `:devtools` (`wi`) will open them at the last used position.
  * The devtool window now has a "qutebrowser developer tools" window title.
  * When a resource is opened from the devtools, it now opens in a proper
    qutebrowser tab.
  * On Fedora, when the `qt5-webengine-devtools` package is missing, an error
    is now shown instead of a blank inspector window.
  * If opened as a window, the devtools are now closed properly when the
    associated tab is closed.
  * When the devtools are clicked, insert mode is entered automatically.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Crash when `tabs.focus_stack_size` is set to -1.
- Crash when a `pdf.js` file for PDF.js exists, but `viewer.html` does not.
- Crash when `:completion-item-yank --sel` is used on a platform without
  primary selection support (e.g. Windows/macOS).
- Crash when there's a feature permission request from Qt with an invalid URL
  (which happens due to a Qt bug with Qt 5.15 in private browsing mode).
- Crash in rare cases where QtWebKit/QtWebEngine imports fail in unexpected
  ways.
- Crash when something removed qutebrowser's IPC socket file and it's been
  running for 6 hours.
- `:config-write-py` now works with paths starting with `~/...` again.
- New site-specific quirk for a missing `globalThis` in Qt <= 5.12 on Reddit
  and Spotify.
- When `;` is added to `hints.chars`, using hint labels containing `;;` now
  works properly.
- Hint letters outside of ASCII should now work.
- When `bindings.key_mappings` is used with hints, it now works properly with
  letters outside of ASCII as well.
- With Qt 5.15, the audible/muted indicators are not updated properly due to a
  Qt bug. This release adds a workaround so that at least the muted indicator
  is shown properly.
- As a workaround for crashes with QtWebEngine versions between 5.12 and 5.14
  (inclusive), changing the user agent (`content.headers.user_agent`) exposed
  to JS now requires a restart. The corresponding HTTP header is not affected.

[[v1.12.0]]
v1.12.0 (2020-06-01)
--------------------

Removed
~~~~~~~

- `tox -e mkvenv` which was deprecated in qutebrowser v1.10.0 is now
  removed. Use the `mkvenv.py` script instead.
- Support for using `config.bind(key, None)` in `config.py` to unbind a
  key was deprecated in v1.8.2 and is now removed. Use
  `config.unbind(key)` instead.
- `:yank markdown` was deprecated in v1.7.0 and is now removed. Use
  `:yank inline [{title}]({url})` instead.

Added
~~~~~

- New `:debug-keytester` command, which shows a "key tester" widget.
  Previously, that was only available as a separate application via `python3 -m
  scripts.keytester`.
- New `:config-diff` command which opens the `qute://configdiff` page.
- New `--debug-flag log-cookies` to log cookies to the debug log.
- New `colors.contextmenu.disabled.{fg,bg}` settings to customize colors for
  disabled items in the context menu.
- New line selection mode (`:toggle-selection --line`), bound to `Shift-V` in caret mode.
- New `colors.webpage.darkmode.*` settings to control Chromium's dark mode.
  Note that those settings only work with QtWebEngine on Qt >= 5.14 and require
  a restart of qutebrowser.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Windows and macOS releases now ship Qt 5.15, which is based on Chromium
  80.0.3987.163 with security fixes up to 81.0.4044.138.
- The `content.cookies.accept` setting now accepts URL patterns.
- Tests are now included in release tarballs. Note that only running them with
  the exact dependencies listed in
  `misc/requirements/requirements-tests.txt{,-raw}` is supported.
- The `:tab-focus` command now has completion for tabs in the current window.
- The `bindings.key_mappings` setting now maps `<Ctrl+I>` to the tab key by default.
- `:tab-give --private` now detaches a tab into a new private window.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Using `:open -s` now only rewrites `http://` in URLs to `https://`, not other
  schemes like `qute://`.
- When an unhandled exception happens in certain parts of the code (outside of
  the main thread), qutebrowser did crash or freeze when trying to show its
  exception handler. This is now fixed.
- `:inspector` now works correctly when cookies are disabled globally.
- Added workaround for a (Gentoo?) PyQt/packaging issue related to the
  `QWebEngineFindTextResult` handling added in v1.11.0.
- When entering caret selection mode (`v, v`) very early before a page is
  loaded, an error is now shown instead of a crash happening.
- The workaround for session loading with Qt 5.15 now handles
  `sessions.lazy_restore` so that the saved page is loaded instead of the
  "stub" page with no possibility to get to the web page.
- A site specific quirk to allow typing accented characters on Google
  Docs was active for docs.google.com, but not drive.google.com. It is
  now applied for both subdomains.
- With older graphics hardware (OpenGL < 4.3) with Qt 5.14 on Wayland, WebGL
  causes segfaults. Now qutebrowser detects that combination and suggests to
  disable WebGL or use XWayland.

[[v1.11.1]]
v1.11.1 (2020-05-07)
--------------------

Security
~~~~~~~~

- CVE-2020-11054: After a certificate error was overridden by the user,
  qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow (`colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg`).
  However, when the affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was
  mistakenly displayed as green (`colors.statusbar.url.success_https`). While
  the user already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set
  `content.ssl_strict` to `false` which is not recommended), this could still
  provide a false sense of security. This is now fixed.

[[v1.11.0]]
v1.11.0 (2020-04-27)
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

- New settings:
  * `search.wrap` which can be set to false to prevent wrapping around the page
    when searching. With QtWebEngine, Qt 5.14 or newer is required.
  * `content.unknown_url_scheme_policy` which allows controlling when an
    external application is opened for external links (never, from user
    interaction, always).
  * `content.fullscreen.overlay_timeout` to configure how long the fullscreen
    overlay should be displayed. If set to `0`, no overlay is displayed.
  * `hints.padding` to add additional padding for hints.
  * `hints.radius` to set a border radius for hints (set to `3` by default).
- New placeholders for `url.searchengines` values:
  * `{unquoted}` inserts the search term without any quoting.
  * `{semiquoted}` (same as `{}`) quotes most special characters, but slashes
    remain unquoted.
  * `{quoted}` (same as `{}` in earlier releases) also quotes slashes.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- First adaptions to Qt 5.15, including a stop-gap measure for session loading
  not working properly with it.
- Searching now wraps around the page by default with QtWebKit (where it didn't
  before). Set `search.wrap` to `false` to restore the old behavior.
- The `{}` placeholder for search engines (the `url.searchengines` setting) now
  does not quote slashes anymore, but other characters typically encoded in
  URLs still get encoded. This matches the behavior of search engines in
  Chromium. To revert to the old behavior, use `{quoted}` instead.
- The `content.windowed_fullscreen` setting got renamed to
  `content.fullscreen.window`.
- Mouse-wheel scrolling is now prevented while hints are active.
- Changes to userscripts:
  * `qute-bitwarden` now has an optional `--totp` flag which can be used
    to copy TOTP codes to clipboard (requires the `pyperclip` module).
  * `readability-js` now opens readability tabs next to the original
    tab (using the `:open --related` flag).
  * `readability-js` now displays a favicon for readability tabs.
  * `password_fill` now triggers a `change` JavaScript event after filling the
    data.
- The `dictcli.py` script now shows better error messages.
- Various improvements to the `mkvenv.py` script (mainly useful for development).
- Minor performance improvements.

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- A warning about old Qt versions is now also shown with Qt 5.9 and 5.10, as
  support for Qt < 5.11 will be dropped in qutebrowser v2.0.

Fixed
~~~~~

- `unsafeWindow` is now defined for Greasemonkey scripts with QtWebKit.
- The proxied `window` global is now shared between different
  Greasemonkey scripts (but still separate from the page's `window`), to
  match the original Greasemonkey implementation.
- The `--output-messages` (`-m`) flag added in v1.9.0 now also works correctly
  when using `:spawn --userscript`.
- `:version` and `--version` now don't crash if there's an (invalid)
  `/etc/os-release` file which has non-comment lines without a `=` character.
- Scripts in `scripts/` now report errors to `stderr` correctly, instead of
  using `stdout`.

[[v1.10.2]]
v1.10.2 (2020-04-17)
--------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Windows and macOS releases now bundle Qt 5.14.2, including security fixes up
  to Chromium 80.0.3987.132.

Fixed
~~~~~

- The WhatsApp workaround now also works when using WhatsApp in languages other
  than English.
- The `mkvenv.py` script now also works properly on Windows.

[[v1.10.1]]
v1.10.1 (2020-02-15)
--------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Crash when saving data fails during shutdown (which was a regression
  introduced in v1.9.0).
- Error while reading config.py when `fonts.tabs` or `fonts.debug_console` is
  set to a value including `default_size`.
- When a `state` file contains invalid UTF-8 data, a proper error is now
  displayed.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- When the Qt version changes (and also on the first start of v1.10.1 on Qt
  5.14), service workers registered by websites are now deleted. This is done
  as a workaround for QtWebEngine issues causing crashes when visiting pages
  using service workers (such as Google Mail/Drive). No persistent data should
  be affected as websites can re-register their service workers, but a (single)
  backup is kept at `webengine/Service Worker-bak` in qutebrowser's data
  directory.
- Better output on stdout when config errors occur.
- The `mkvenv.py` now ensures the latest versions of `setuptools` and `wheel`
  are installed in the virtual environment, which should speed up installation
  and fix install issues.
- The default for `colors.statusbar.command.private.bg` has been changed to a
  slightly different gray, as a workaround for a Qt issue where the cursor was
  invisible in that case.

[[v1.10.0]]
v1.10.0 (2020-02-02)
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

- New `colors.webpage.prefers_color_scheme_dark` setting which allows forcing
  `prefers-color-scheme: dark` colors for websites (QtWebEngine with Qt 5.14 or
  newer).
- New `fonts.default_size` setting which can be used to set a bigger font size
  for all UI fonts.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The `fonts.monospace` setting has been removed and replaced by
  `fonts.default_family`. The new `default_family` setting is improved in
  various ways:
  * It accepts a list of font families (or a single font family) rather than a
    comma-separated string. As an example, instead of
    `fonts.monospace = "Courier, Monaco"`, use
    `fonts.default_family = ["Courier", "Monaco"]`.
  * Since a list is now accepted as value, no quoting of font names with spaces
    is required anymore. As an example, instead of
    `fonts.monospace = '"xos4 Terminus"'`, use
    `fonts.default_family = 'xos4 Terminus'`.
  * It is now empty by default rather than having a long list of font names in
    the default config. When the value is empty, the system's default
    monospaced font is used.
- If `monospace` is now used in a font value, it's used literally and not
  replaced anymore. Instead, `default_family` is replaced as explained above.
- The default `content.headers.accept_language` value now adds a `;q=0.9`
  classifier which should make the value sent more in-line with what other
  browsers do.
- The `qute-pass` userscript now has a new `--mode gopass` switch which uses
  gopass rather than pass.
- The `tox -e mkvenv` (or `mkvenv-pypi`) way of installing qutebrowser is now
  replaced by a `mkvenv.py` script. See the updated
  link:install{outfilesuffix}#tox[install instructions] for details.
- macOS and Windows releases now ship with Qt/QtWebEngine 5.14.1
  * Based on Chromium 77.0.3865.129 with security fixes up to Chromium 79.0.3945.117.
  * Sandboxing is now enabled on Windows.
  * Monospace fonts are now used when a website requests them on macOS 10.15.
  * Web notifications are now supported.

Fixed
~~~~~

- When quitting qutebrowser, components are now cleaned up differently. This
  should fix certain (rare) segmentation faults and exceptions when quitting,
  especially with the new exit scheme introduced in in PyQt5 5.13.1.
- Added a workaround for per-domain settings (e.g. a JavaScript whitelist) not
  being applied in some scenarios with Qt 5.13 and above.
- Added additional site-specific quirk for WhatsApp Web.
- The `qute-pass` userscript now works correctly when a `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR`
  ending with a trailing slash is given.

[[v1.9.0]]
v1.9.0 (2020-01-08)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Initial support for Qt 5.14.
- New `content.site_specific_quirks` setting which enables workarounds for
  websites with broken user agent parsing (enabled by default, see the "Fixed"
  section for fixed websites).
- New `qt.force_platformtheme` setting to force Qt to use a given platform
  theme.
- New `tabs.tooltips` setting which can be used to disable hover tooltips for
  tabs.
- New settings to configure the appearance of context menus:
  * `fonts.contextmenu`
  * `colors.contextmenu.menu.bg`
  * `colors.contextmenu.menu.fg`
  * `colors.contextmenu.selected.bg`
  * `colors.contextmenu.selected.fg`

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The macOS binaries now require macOS 10.13 High Sierra or newer. Support for
  macOS 10.12 Sierra has been dropped.
- The `content.headers.user_agent` setting now is a format string with the
  default value resembling the behavior of it being set to null before.
  This slightly changes the sent user agent for QtWebKit: Instead of mentioning
  qutebrowser and its version it now mentions the Qt version.
- The `qute-pass` userscript now has a new `--extra-url-suffixes` (`-s`)
  argument which passes extra URL suffixes to the tldextract library.
- A stack is now used for `:tab-focus last` rather than just saving one tab.
  Additionally, `:tab-focus` now understands `stack-prev` and `stack-next`
  arguments to traverse that stack.
- `:hint` now has a new `right-click` target which allows right-clicking
  elements via hints.
- The Terminus font has been removed from the default monospace fonts since it
  caused trouble with HighDPI setups. To get it back, add either
  `"xos4 Terminus"` or `Terminus` (depending on fontconfig version) to the
  beginning of the `fonts.monospace` setting.
- As a workaround for a Qt bug causing a segfault, desktop sharing is now
  automatically rejected on Qt versions before 5.13.2. Note that screen sharing
  still won't work on Linux before Qt 5.14.
- Comment lines in quickmarks/bookmarks files are now ignored. However, note that
  qutebrowser will overwrite those files if bookmark/quickmark commands are used.
- Reopening PDF.js pages from e.g. a session file will now re-download and
  display those PDFs.
- Improved behavior when using `:open-download` in a sandboxed environment (KDE
  Flatpak).
- qutebrowser now enables the new PyQt exit scheme, which should result in
  things being cleaned up more properly (e.g. cookies being saved even without
  a timeout) on PyQt 5.13.1 and newer.
- The `:spawn` command has a new `-m` / `--output-messages` argument which
  shows qutebrowser messages based on a command's standard output/error.
- Improved insert mode detection for some CodeMirror usages (e.g. in
  JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook).
- If JavaScript is disabled globally, `file://*` now doesn't automatically have
  it enabled anymore. Run `:set -u file://* content.javascript.enabled true` to
  restore the previous behavior.
- Settings with URL patterns can now be used to affect the behavior of the
  QtWebEngine inspector. Note that the underlying URL is `chrome-devtools://*`
  from Qt 5.11 to Qt 5.13, but `devtools://*` with Qt 5.14.
- Improvements when `tabs.tabs_are_windows` is set:
  * Using `:tab-take` and `:tab-give` now shows an error, as the effect of
    doing so would be equal to `:tab-clone`.
  * The `:buffer` completion doesn't show any window sections anymore, only a
    flat list of tabs.
- Improved parsing in some corner cases for the `QtFont` type (used for
  `fonts.tabs` and `fonts.debug_console`).
- Performance improvements for the following areas:
  * Adding settings with URL patterns
  * Matching of settings using URL patterns

Fixed
~~~~~

- Downloads (e.g. via `:download`) now see the same user agent header as
  webpages, which fixes cases where overly restrictive servers/WAFs closed the
  connection before.
- `dictcli.py` now works correctly on Windows again.
- The logic for `:restart` has been revisited, which should fix issues with
  relative basedirs.
- Remaining issues related to Python 3.8 are now fixed (mostly warnings,
  especially on QtWebKit).
- Workaround for a Qt bug where a page never finishes loading with a
  non-overridable TLS error (e.g. due to HSTS).
- The `qute://configdiff` page now doesn't show built-in settings (e.g.
  javascript being enabled for `qute://` and `chrome://` pages) anymore.
- The `qute-lastpass` userscript now stops prompting for passwords when
  cancelling the password input.
- The tab hover text now shows ampersands (&) correctly.
- With QtWebEngine and Qt >= 5.11, the inspector now shows its icons correctly
  even if loading of images is disabled via the `content.images` setting.
- Entering a very long string (over 50k characters) in the completion used to
  crash, now it shows an error message instead.
- Various improvements for URL/searchengine detection:
  * Strings with a dot but with characters not allowed in a URL (e.g. an
    underscore) are now not treated as URL anymore.
  * Strings like "5/8" are now not treated as IP anymore.
  * URLs with an explicit scheme and a space (%20) are correctly treated as
    URLs.
  * Mail addresses are now treated as search terms.
  * With `url.open_base_url` set, searching for a search engine name now works.
  * `url.open_base_url = True` together with `url.auto_search = 'never'` is now
    handled correctly.
  * Fixed crash when a search engine URL turns out to be invalid.
- New "site specific quirks", which work around some broken websites:
  * WhatsApp Web
  * Google Accounts
  * Slack (with older QtWebEngine versions)
  * Dell.com support pages (with Qt 5.7)
  * Google Docs (fixes broken IME/compose key)

[[v1.8.3]]
v1.8.3 (2019-12-05)
-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Segmentation fault introduced in v1.8.2 when a tab gets closed immediately
  after it has finished loading (e.g. with certain login flows).

[[v1.8.2]]
v1.8.2 (2019-11-22)
-------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Windows/macOS releases now ship with Qt 5.12.6. This includes security fixes
  up to Chromium 77.0.3865.120 plus a security fix for CVE-2019-13720 from
  Chromium 78.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Unbinding keys via `config.bind(key, None)` accidentally worked in
  v1.7.0 but raises an exception in v1.8.0. It now works again, but is
  deprecated and shows an error. Note that `:config-py-write` did write
  such invalid lines before v1.8.0, so existing config files might need
  adjustments.
- The `readability-js` userscript now handles encodings correctly (which it
  didn't before for some websites).
- <Shift-Insert> can now be used to paste text starting with a hyphen.
- Following hints via the number keypad now works properly again.
- Errors while reading the state file are now displayed instead of causing a
  crash.
- Crash when using `:debug-log-level` without a console attached.
- Downloads are now hidden properly when the browser is in fullscreen mode.
- Crash when setting `colors.webpage.bg` to an empty value with QtWebKit.
- Crash when the history database file is not a proper sqlite database.

-------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- No code changes - this release only repackages the Windows/macOS
  releases due to issues with the v1.8.0 release.
- Updated dependencies for Windows/macOS releases:
  * macOS and Windows releases now ship with Qt/QtWebEngine 5.12.5. Those
    are based on Chromium 69.0.3497.128 with security fixes up to Chromium
    76.0.3809.87.
  * Qt 5.13 couldn't be used yet due to various bugs in Qt 5.13.0 and .1.

[[v1.8.0]]
v1.8.0 (2019-09-25)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- New userscripts:
  * `readability-js` which uses Mozilla's node.js readability library.
  * `qute-bitwarden` which integrates the Bitwarden CLI.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The statusbar text for passthrough mode now shows all configured bindings to
  leave the mode, not only one.
- When `:config-source` is used with a relative filename, the file is now
  searched in the config directory instead of the current working directory.
- HTML5 inputs with date/time types now enter insert mode when selected.
- `dictcli.py` now shows where dictionaries are installed to and complains when
  running it as root if doing so would result in a wrong installation path.
- The Makefile now can also run `setup.py build` when invoked without a target.
- Changes to userscripts:
  * qute-pass: Don't run `pass` if only a username is requested.
  * qute-pass: Support private domains like `myrouter.local`.
  * readability: Improved CSS styling.
- Performance improvements in various areas:
  * Loading config files
  * Typing without any completion matches
  * General keyboard handling
  * Scrolling
- `:version` now shows details about the loaded autoconfig.yml/config.py.
- Hosts are now additionally looked up including their ports in netrc files.
- With Qt 5.10 or newer, qutebrowser now doesn't force software rendering with
  Nouveau drivers anymore. However, QtWebEngine/Chromium still do so.
- The XSS Auditor is now disabled by default (`content.xss_auditing` =
  `false`). This reflects a similar change in Chromium, see
  their https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/xss-auditor[XSS
  Auditor Design Document] for details.

Fixed
~~~~~

- `:config-write-py` now correctly writes `config.unbind(...)` lines (instead
  of `config.bind(..., None)`) when unbinding a default keybinding.
- Prevent repeat keyup events for JavaScript when a key is held down.
- The Makefile now rebuilds the manpage correctly.
- `~/.config/qutebrowser/blocked-hosts` can now also contain /etc/hosts-like
  lines, not just simple hostnames.
- Restored compatibility with Jinja2 2.8 (e.g. used on Debian Stretch or Ubuntu
  16.04 LTS).
- Fixed implicit type conversion warning with Python 3.8.
- The desktop file now sets `StartupWMClass` correctly, so the qutebrowser icon
  is no longer shown twice in the Gnome dock when pinned.
- Bindings involving keys which need the AltGr key now work properly.
- Fixed crash (caused by a Qt bug) when typing characters above the Unicode BMP
  (such as certain emoji or CJK characters).
- `dictcli.py` now works properly again.
- Shift can now be used while typing hint keystrings, which e.g. allows typing
  number hints on French keyboards.
- With rapid hinting in number mode, backspace now edits the filter text after
  following a hint.
- A certain type of error ("locking protocol") while initializing sqlite now
  isn't handled as crash anymore.
- Crash when showing a permission request in certain scenarios.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- At least Python 3.5.2 is now required to run qutebrowser, support for 3.5.0
  and 3.5.1 was dropped.


[[v1.7.0]]
v1.7.0 (2019-07-18)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- New settings:
  * `colors.tabs.pinned.*` to control colors of pinned tabs.
  * `hints.leave_on_load` which allows disabling leaving of hint mode when a
    new page is loaded.
  * `colors.completion.item.selected.match.fg` which allows configuring the
    text color for the matching text in the currently selected completion item.
  * `tabs.undo_stack_size` to limit how many undo entries are kept for closed tabs.
- New commands:
  * `:reverse-selection` (`o` in caret mode) to swap the stationary/moving ends
    of a selection.
- New commandline replacements:
  * `{url:domain}`, `{url:auth}`, `{url:scheme}`, `{url:username}`,
    `{url:password}`, `{url:host}`, `{url:port}`, `{url:path}`, `{url:query}`
    for the respective parts of the current URL.
  * `{title}` for the current page title.
- The `{title}` field in `tabs.title.format`, `tabs.title.format_pinned` and
  `window.title_format` got renamed to `{current_title}` (mirroring
  `{current_url}`) in order to not conflict with the new `{title}` commandline
  replacement.
- New `delete` target for `:hint` which removes the hinted element from
  the DOM.
- New `--config-py` commandline argument to use a custom `config.py` file.
- Qt 5.13: Support for notifications (shown via system tray).

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Updated dependencies for Windows/macOS releases:
   - PyQt5 5.12.3 / PyQtWebEngine 5.12.1
   - Qt 5.12.4, which includes security fixes up to Chromium 74.0.3729.157
   - Python 3.7.4
   - OpenSSL 1.1.1
   - Note: This release includes Qt 5.12.4 instead of Qt 5.13.0 due to
     https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-76913[QTBUG-76913] causing frequent
     segfaults with Qt 5.13. After Qt 5.13.1 is released, qutebrowser v1.8.0
     will be released with an updated Qt.
- Completely revamped Windows installer which allows installing without admin
  permissions and allows setting qutebrowser as default browser.
- The desktop file `qutebrowser.desktop` is now renamed to
  `org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser.desktop`.
- Pinned tabs now always show a favicon (even if the site doesn't provide one)
  when shrinking.
- Setting `downloads.location.directory` now changes the directory displayed in
  the download prompt even if `downloads.location.remember` is set.
- The `yank` command gained a new `inline` argument, which allows to e.g. use
  `:yank inline [{title}]({url})`.
- Duplicate consecutive history entries with the same URL are now ignored.
- More detailed error messages when spawning a process failed.
- The `content.pdfjs` setting now supports domain patterns.
- Improved process status output with `:spawn -o`.
- The `colors.tabs.bar.bg` setting is now of type `QssColor` and thus supports
  gradients.
- The `:fullscreen` command now understands a new `--enter` flag which
  causes it to always enter fullscreen instead of toggling the current
  state.
- `--debug-flag stack` is now needed to show stack traces on renderer process
  crashes.
- `--debug-flag chromium` can be used to easily turn on verbose Chromium logging.
- For runtime data (such as the IPC socket), a proper runtime path is now used
  on BSD; only macOS/Windows continue to use the temporary directory.
- PDF.js is now also searched in `/app/share/pdf.js/` (for Flatpak)
- Permission prompts can now be answered with `Y` (`:prompt-accept --save yes`)
  and `N` (`:prompt-accept --save no`) to save the answer as a per-domain
  setting.
- `content.dns_prefetch` is now turned off by default, as it causes crashes
  inside QtWebEngine.
- The (still unofficial) interceptor plugin API now contains `resource_type`
  for a request and allows redirecting requests.
- `:bookmark-remove` now shows a message for consistency with `:bookmark-add`.
- Very early segfaults are now also caught by the crash handler.
- The appdata XML now contains proper release information and an (empty) OARS
  content rating.
- Improved Linux distribution detection.
- Qt 5.13: Request filtering now happens in the UI rather than IO thread.
- Qt 5.13: Support for PDFium (Chromium's PDF viewer) is disabled for now so
  that PDFs can still be downloaded (or shown with PDF.js) properly.
- Various performance improvements (e.g. for showing hints or the :open
  completion).

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- `:yank markdown` got deprecated, as `:yank inline [{title}]({url})` can now
  be used instead.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Various QtWebEngine load signals are now handled differently, which should
  fix issues with insert mode being left while typing on sites like Google
  Translate.
- Race condition causing a colored statusbar in normal mode when
  entering/exiting caret mode quickly.
- Using `100%` for a hue in a `hsv(...)` config value now corresponds to 359
  (rather than 255), matching the fixed behavior in Qt 5.13.
- Chaining commands with `;;` used to abort with some failing commands. It now
  runs the second command no matter whether the first one succeeded or not.
- Handling of profiles and private windows (and resulting crashes with Qt
  5.12.2).
- Fixes for corner-cases when using `:navigate increment/decrement`.
- The type for the `colors.hints.match.fg` setting was changed to `QtColor`.
  Gradients were never supported for this setting, and with this change, values
  like `rgb(0, 0, 0)` now work as well.
- Permission prompts now show a properly normalized URL with QtWebKit.
- Crash on start when PyQt was built without SSL support with Qt >= 5.12.
- Minor memory leaks.

~~~~~

- Crash when hinting and changing/closing the tab before hints are displayed.
- Crash on redirects with Qt 5.13.
- Hide bogus `AA_ShareOpenGLContexts` warning with Qt 5.12.4.
- Workaround for renderer process crashes with Qt 5.12.4.
  If you're unable to update, you can remove `~/.cache/qutebrowser` for the
  same result.

[[v1.6.2]]
v1.6.2 (2019-05-06)
-------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Windows/macOS releases now ship with Qt 5.12.3, which includes security fixes
  up to Chromium 73.0.3683.75.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Crash when SQL errors occur while using the completion.
- Crash when cancelling a download prompt started in an already closed window.
- Crash when many prompts are opened at the same time.
- Running without Qt installed now displays a proper error again.
- High CPU usage when using the keyhint widget with a low delay.
- Crash with Qt >= 5.14 on redirects.

[[v1.6.1]]
v1.6.1 (2019-03-20)
-------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Windows/macOS releases now ship with Qt 5.12.2, which includes
  security fixes up to Chromium 72.0.3626.121 (including CVE-2019-5786
  which is known to be exploited in the wild).

Fixed
~~~~~

- Crash when using `:config-{dict,list}-{add,remove}` with an invalid setting.
- Functionality like hinting on pages with an element with ID `_qutebrowser` (such as qutebrowser.org) on Qt 5.12.
- The .desktop file in v1.6.0 was missing the "Actions" key, which is now fixed.
- The SVG icon now has a size of 256x256px set to comply with freedesktop standards.
- Setting `colors.statusbar.*.bg` to a gradient now has the expected effect of
  the gradient spanning the entire statusbar.

[[v1.6.0]]
v1.6.0 (2019-02-25)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- New settings:
  * `tabs.new_position.stacking` which controls whether new tabs opened from a
    page should stack on each other or not.
  * `completion.open_categories` which allows to configure which categories are
    shown in the `:open` completion, and how they are ordered.
  * `tabs.pinned.frozen` to allow/deny navigating in pinned tabs.
  * `hints.selectors` which allows to configure what CSS selectors are used for
    hints, and also allows adding custom hint groups.
  * `input.insert_mode.leave_on_load` to turn off leaving insert mode when a
    new page is loaded.
- New config manipulation commands:
  * `:config-dict-add` and `:config-list-add` to a new element to a dict/list
    setting.
  * `:config-dict-remove` and `:config-list-remove` to remove an element from a
    dict/list setting.
- New `:yank markdown` feature which yanks the current URL and title in
  markdown format.
- Support for new QtWebEngine features in Qt 5.12:
  * Basic support for client certificates. Selecting the certificate to use
    when there are multiple matching certificates isn't implemented yet.
  * Support for DNS prefetching (plus new `content.dns_prefetch` setting).

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Various changes to the Windows and macOS builds:
  * Bundling Qt 5.12.1, based on Chromium 69.0.3497.128 with security fixes up
    to 71.0.3578.94.
  * Windows: A 32-bit build is available again.
  * Windows: The builds now bundle the Universal CRT DLLs, causing them to work
    on earlier versions of Windows 10.
  * macOS: Support for OS X 10.11 El Capitan was dropped, requiring macOS 10.12
    Sierra or newer.
  * macOS: The IPC socket path used to communicate with existing instances
    changed due to changes in Qt 5.12. Please make sure to quit qutebrowser
    before upgrading.
- `:q` now closes the current window instead of quitting qutebrowser completely
  (`:close`), while `:qa` quits (`:quit`). The behavior of `:wq` remains
  unchanged (`:quit --save`), as closing a window while saving the session
  doesn't make sense.
- Completion highlighting is now done differently (using `QSyntaxHighlighter`),
  which should fix some highlighting corner-cases.
- The `QtColor` config type now also understands colors like `rgb(...)`.
- `:yank` now has a `--quiet` option which causes it to not display a message.
- The `:open` completion now also shows search engines by default.
- The `content.host_blocking.enabled` setting now supports URL patterns, so the
  adblocker can be disabled on a given page.
- Elements with a `tabindex` attribute now also get hints by default.
- Various small performance improvements for hints and the completion.
- The Wayland check for QtWebEngine is now disabled on Qt >= 5.11.2, as those
  versions should work without any issues.
- The JavaScript `console` object is now available in PAC files.
- PAC proxies currently don't work properly on QtWebEngine (and never did), so
  an error is now shown when trying to configure a PAC proxy.
- The metainfo file `qutebrowser.appdata.xml` is now renamed to
  `org.qutebrowser.qutebrowser.appdata.xml`.
- The `qute-pass` userscript now understands domains in gpg filenames
  in addition to directory names.
- The autocompletion for `content.headers.user_agent` got updated to only
  include the default and Chrome, as setting the UA to Firefox has various
  bad side-effects.
- Combining Qt 5.12 with an older PyQt can lead to issues, so a warning is
  now shown when starting qutebrowser with that combination.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Invalid world IDs now get rejected for `:jseval` and GreaseMonkey scripts.
- When websites suggest download filenames with invalid characters, those are
  now correctly replaced.
- Invalid hint length calculation in certain rare cases.
- Dragging tabs in the tab bar (which was broken in v1.5.0)
- Using Shift-Home in command mode now works properly.
- Workaround for a Qt bug which prevented
  `content.cookies.accept = no-3rdparty` from working properly on some pages
  like GMail. However, the default for `content.cookies.accept` is still `all`
  to be in line with what other browsers do.
- `:navigate` not incrementing in anchors or queries.
- Crash when trying to use a proxy requiring authentication with QtWebKit.
- Slashes in search terms are now percent-escaped.
- When `scrolling.bar = True` was set in versions before v1.5.0, this now
  correctly gets migrated to `always` instead of `when-searching`.
- Completion highlighting now works again on Qt 5.11.3 and 5.12.1.
- The non-standard header `X-Do-Not-Track` is no longer sent.
- PAC proxies were never correctly supported with QtWebEngine, but are now
  explicitly disallowed.
- macOS: Context menus for download items now show in the correct macOS style.
- Issues with fullscreen handling when exiting a video player.
- Various fixes for Qt 5.12 issues:
  * A javascript error on page load was fixed.
  * `window.print()` works with Qt 5.12 now.
  * Fixed handling of duplicate download filenames.
  * Fixed broken `qute://history` page.
  * Fixed PDF.js not working properly.
  * The download button in PDF.js now works (it's not possible to make
    it work with earlier Qt versions).
  * Since Greasemonkey scripts modifying the DOM fail when being run at
    document-start, some known-broken scripts (Iridium, userstyles.org) are now
    forced to run at document-end.

[[v1.5.2]]
v1.5.2 (2018-10-26)
-------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The `content.cookies.accept` setting is now set to `all` instead of
  `no-3rdparty` by default, as `no-3rdparty` breaks various pages such as
  GMail.

[[v1.5.1]]

-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Flickering when opening/closing tabs (as soon as more than 10 are open) on
  some pages.
- PDF.js is now bundled again with the macOS/Windows release.
- PDF.js is now searched in the correct path (if not installed system-wide)
  instead of hardcoding `~/.local/share/qutebrowser`.
- Improved logging for PDF.js resources which fail to load.
- Crash when closing a tab after doing a search.
- Tabs appearing when hidden after e.g. closing tabs.

[[v1.5.0]]
v1.5.0 (2018-10-03)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Rewritten PDF.js support:
  * PDF.js support and the `content.pdfjs` setting are now also available with
    QtWebEngine.
  * Opening a PDF file now doesn't start a second request anymore.
  * Opening PDFs on https:// sites now works properly.
  * New `--pdfjs` flag for `prompt-open-download`, so PDFs can be opened in
    PDF.js with `<Ctrl-P>` in the download prompt.
- New settings:
  * `content.mouse_lock` to handle HTML5 pointer locking.
  * `completion.web_history.exclude` which hides a list of URL patterns from
    the completion.
  * `qt.process_model` which can be used to change Chromium's process model.
  * `qt.low_end_device_mode` which turns on Chromium's low-end device mode.
    This mode uses less RAM, but the expense of performance.
  * `content.webrtc_ip_handling_policy`, which allows more
    fine-grained/restrictive control about which IPs are exposed via WebRTC.
  * `tabs.max_width` which allows to have a more "normal" look for tabs.
  * `content.mute` which allows to mute pages (or all tabs) by default.
- Running qutebrowser with QtWebKit or Qt < 5.9 now shows a warning (only
  once), as support for those is going to be removed in a future release.
- New t[iI][hHu] default bindings (similar to `tsh` etc.) to toggle images.
- The qute-pass userscript now has optional OTP support.
- When `:spawn --userscript` is called with a count, that count is now
  passed to userscripts as `$QUTE_COUNT`.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Windows and macOS releases now bundle Python 3.7, PyQt 5.11.3 and Qt 5.11.2.
  QtWebEngine includes security fixes up to Chromium 68.0.3440.75 and
  https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtwebengine.git/tree/dist/changes-5.11.2/?h=v5.11.2[various other fixes].
- Various performance improvements when many tabs are opened.
- The `content.headers.referer` setting now works on QtWebEngine.
- The `:repeat` command now takes a count which is multiplied with the given
  "times" argument.
- The default keybinding to leave passthrough mode was changed from `<Ctrl-V>`
  to `<Shift-Escape>`, which makes pasting from the clipboard easier in
  passthrough mode and is also unlikely to conflict with webpage bindings.
- The `app_id` is now set to `qutebrowser` for Wayland.
- `Command` or `Cmd` can now be used (instead of `Meta`) to map the Command key
  on macOS.
- Using `:set option` now shows the value of the setting (like `:set option?`
  already did).
- The `completion.web_history_max_items` setting got renamed to
  `completion.web_history.max_items`.
- The Makefile shipped with qutebrowser now supports overriding variables
  `DATADIR` and `MANDIR`.

  patterns instead of globs.
- In passthrough mode, Ctrl + Mousewheel now also gets passed through to the
  page instead of zooming.
- Editing text in an external editor now simulates a JS "input" event, which
  improves compatibility with websites reacting via JS to input.
- The `qute://settings` page is now properly sorted on Python 3.5.
- `:zoom`, `:zoom-in` and `:zoom-out` now have a `--quiet` switch which causes
  them to not display a message.
- The `scrolling.bar` setting now takes three values instead of being a
  boolean: `always`, `never`, and `when-searching` (which only displays it
  while a search is active).
- '@@' now repeats the last run macro.
- The `content.host_blocking.lists` setting now accepts a `file://` URL to a
  directory, and reads all files in that directory.
- The `:tab-give` and `:tab-take` command now have a new flag `--keep` which
  causes them to keep the old tab around.
- `:navigate` now clears the URL query.

Fixed
~~~~~

- `qute://` pages now work properly on Qt 5.11.2
- Error when passing a substring with spaces to `:tab-take`.
- Greasemonkey scripts which start with a UTF-8 BOM are now handled correctly.
- When no documentation has been generated, the plaintext documentation now can
  be shown for more files such as `qute://help/userscripts.html`.
- Crash when doing initial run on Wayland without XWayland.
- Crash when trying to load an empty session file.
- `:hint` with an invalid `--mode=` value now shows a proper error.
- Rare crash on Qt 5.11.2 when clicking on `<select>` elements.

[[v1.4.2]]
v1.4.2 (2018-09-02)
-------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The `content.xss_auditing` setting is now enabled by default, to mirror
  Chromium's rather than Qt's default behavior.
- Long URLs in the statusbar are now elided at the end rather than in the
  middle, to make sure the hostname is completely visible whenever possible.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Crash in Qt 5.7.1 when a website uses `window.print()`.
- The workaround for Nouveau graphic drivers now works properly again.
- Crash when using `:follow-selected` with a link which is outside of the view.
- Workaround for windows not showing as urgent with some window managers
  (like i3).
- Crash when opening URLs with some unicode characters (IDNA 2008). Those URLs
  still won't open though, due to missing support in Qt.
- Crash when a download directory which can't be created is configured.
- Crash in the `importer.py` script when importing Chrome bookmarks from newer Chrome versions.
- The `content.webrtc_public_interfaces_only` option didn't work on Qt 5.11 previously (it now does).
  Note it still does not work on Qt 5.10 (due to a Qt bug) and Qt < 5.9.2.
- Repeated escaping of entries in `qute://log` when refreshing page.
- The host blocker doesn't block 0.0.0.0 anymore.

- Deleting history items via `:history-clear` or `:completion-item-del` now
  also removes that URL from QtWebEngine's visited links.
- There's now completion for commands taking a variable count of arguments
  (like `:config-cycle`).
- QtWebEngine: On Qt 5.11.1, no reloads are needed anymore when switching
  between pages with changed settings (e.g. `content.javascript.enabled`).
- The `qt.force_software_rendering` setting changed from a boolean to taking
  different values (`software-opengl`, `qt-quick` and `chromium`) for different
  kinds of software rendering workarounds.
- On Qt 5.11, using wayland with QtWebEngine is now possible when using
  software rendering.
- GreaseMonkey scripts now get their own global scope (based on the page's

  element if there's no selection.
- The `--logfilter` argument now can be prepended with an exclamation mark
  (e.g. `--logfilter '!init,destroy'`) to invert the filter.
- `:view-source` now has a `--pygments` flag which uses the "old" way of
  rendering sources even with QtWebEngine.

  different JavaScript context.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Various subtle keyboard focus issues.
- The security fix in v1.3.3 caused URLs with ampersands

  the `qute://history` page.
- Crash when opening a PDF page with PDF.js enabled (on QtWebKit), but no
  PDF.js installed.
- Crash when closing a tab shortly after opening it.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- No prebuilt binaries for 32-bit Windows are supplied anymore. This is due to
  Qt removing QtWebEngine support for those upstream. It might be possible to
  distribute 32-bit binaries again with Qt 5.12 in December, but that will only
  happen if it turns out enough people actually need 32-bit support.
- `:tab-detach` which has been deprecated in v1.1.0 has been removed.
- The `content.developer_extras` setting got removed. On QtWebKit, developer
  extras are now automatically enabled when opening the inspector.

-------------------

Security
~~~~~~~~

- CVE-2018-1000559: An XSS vulnerability on the `qute://history` page allowed
  websites to inject HTML into the page via a crafted title tag. This could
  allow them to steal your browsing history. If you're currently unable to
  upgrade, avoid using `:history`. See the related GitHub issue for details:
  https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/4011.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Crash in a workaround for a Qt 5.11 bug in rare circumstances.
- Workaround for a Qt bug which preserves searches between page loads.
- In v1.3.2 a dependency on the `PyQt5.QtQuickWidgets` module was accidentally

  again.

[[v1.3.2]]
v1.3.2 (2018-06-10)
-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- QtWebEngine: Improved workaround for a bug in Qt 5.11 where only the

  unnecessary reloads are done now.
- QtWebEngine: It's now possible to open external links such as `magnet://` or
  `mailto:` via hints.

[[v1.3.1]]
v1.3.1 (2018-05-29)

Fixed
~~~~~

- Work around a bug in Qt 5.11 where only the top/bottom half of the window is used.
  This workaround is incomplete, but fixes the majority of the cases where this happens.
- Work around keyboard focus issues with Qt 5.11.

  * `qute-keepass` to get passwords from KeePassX.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- QtWebEngine: Support for JavaScript Shared Web Workers have been disabled on
  Qt versions older than 5.11 because of security issues in in Chromium.
  You can get the same effect in earlier versions via
  `:set qt.args ['disable-shared-workers']`. An equivalent workaround is also
  contained in Qt 5.9.5 and 5.10.1.
- The file dialog for downloads now has basic tab completion based on the
  entered text.

  `True`), `'never'` (was `False`) and `'pinned'` (to only show favicons for
  pinned tabs).
- Hover tooltips on tabs now always show the webpage's title.
- The default value for `content.host_blocking.lists` was changed to only
  include https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts[Steven Black's hosts-list] which

[[v1.2.1]]
v1.2.1 (2018-03-14)
-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- qutebrowser now starts properly when the PyQt5 QOpenGLFunctions package wasn't
  found.
- The keybinding cheatsheet on the quickstart page is now loaded from a local
  `qute://` URL again.
- With "tox -e mkvenv-pypi", PyQt 5.10.0 is used again instead of Qt 5.10.1,
  because of an issue with Qt 5.10.1 which causes qutebrowser to fail to start
  ("Could not find QtWebEngineProcess").
- Unbinding keys which were bound in older qutebrowser versions now doesn't
  crash anymore.

[[v1.2.0]]
v1.2.0 (2018-03-09)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Initial implementation of per-domain settings:
  * `:set` and `:config-cycle` now have a `-u`/`--pattern` argument taking a
    https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns[URL match pattern]
    for supported settings.
  * `config.set` in `config.py` now takes a third argument which is the pattern.
  * New `with config.pattern('...') as p:` context manager for `config.py` to
    use the shorthand syntax with a pattern.
  * New `tsh` keybinding to toggle scripts for the current host. With a capital
    `S`, the toggle is saved. With a capital `H`, subdomains are included. With
    `u` instead of `h`, the exact current URL is used.
  * New `tph` keybinding to toggle plugins, with the same additional binding
    described above.
- New QtWebEngine features:
  * Caret/visual mode
  * Authentication via ~/.netrc
  * Retrying downloads with Qt 5.10 or newer
  * Hinting and other features inside same-origin frames
- New flags for existing commands:
  * `:session-load` has a new `--delete` flag which deletes the

    the currently focused one.
  * New `--edit` flag for `:view-source` to open the source in an external editor.
  * New `--select` flag for `:follow-hint` which acts like the given string was entered but doesn't necessary follow the hint.

- New settings:
  * `statusbar.widgets` to configure which widgets should be shown in which
    order in the statusbar.
  * `tabs.mode_on_change` which replaces `tabs.persist_mode_on_change`. It can
    now be set to `restore` which remembers input modes (input/passthrough)
    per tab.
  * `input.insert_mode.auto_enter` which makes it possible to disable entering
    insert mode automatically when an editable element was clicked. Together
    with `input.forward_unbound_keys`, this should allow for emacs-like
    "modeless" keybindings.
- New `:prompt-yank` command (bound to `Alt-y` by default) to yank URLs
  referenced in prompts.
- The `hostblock_blame` script which was removed in v1.0 was updated for the new
  config and re-added.
- New `cycle-inputs.js` script in `scripts/` which can be used with `:jseval -f`
  to cycle through inputs.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Complete refactoring of key input handling, with various effects:
  * emacs-like keychains such as `<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-C>` can now be bound.
  * Key chains can now be bound in any mode (this allows binding unused keys in
    hint mode).
  * Yes/no prompts don't use keybindings from the `prompt` section anymore, they
    have their own `yesno` section instead.
  * Trying to bind invalid keys now shows an error.
  * The `bindings.default` setting can now only be set in a `config.py`, and
    existing values in `autoconfig.yml` are ignored.
- Improvements for GreaseMonkey support:
  * `@include` and `@exclude` now support regex matches. With QtWebEngine and Qt
    5.8 and newer, Qt handles the matching, but similar functionality will be
    added in Qt 5.11.
  * Support for `@requires`
  * Support for the GreaseMonkey 4.0 API
- The sqlite history now uses write-ahead logging which should be
  a performance and stability improvement.
- When an editor is spawned with `:open-editor` and `:config-edit`, the changes
  are now applied as soon as the file is saved in the editor.
- The `hist_importer.py` script now only imports URL schemes qutebrowser can
  handle.
- Deleting a prefix (`:`, `/` or `?`) via backspace now leaves command mode.
- Angular 1 elements and `<summary>`/`<details>` now get hints assigned.
- `:tab-only` with pinned tabs now still closes unpinned tabs.

  reported in one error.
- More performance improvements when opening/closing many tabs.
- The `:version` page now has a button to pastebin the information.
- Replacements like `{url}` can now be escaped as `{{url}}`.

Fixed
~~~~~

  when filtering them in the completion.
- `:bookmark-add "" foo` can now be used to save the current URL with a custom
  title.

- Exception types are now shown properly with `:config-source` and `:config-edit`.
- When using `:bookmark-add --toggle`, bookmarks are now saved properly.
- Crash when opening an invalid URL from an application on macOS.

  changing qutebrowser versions while it's open.
- Setting `bindings.key_mappings` to an empty value is now allowed.
- Bindings to an empty commands are now ignored rather than crashing.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- `QUTE_SELECTED_HTML` is now not set for userscripts anymore except when called
  via hints.
- The `qutebrowser_viewsource` userscript has been removed as
  `:view-source --edit` can now be used.

-------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- The Makefile now actually works.
- Fixed crashes with Qt 5.10 when closing a tab before it finished loading.

[[v1.1.0]]
v1.1.0 (2018-01-15)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Initial support for Greasemonkey scripts. There are still some rough edges,
  but many scripts should already work.
- There's now a `misc/Makefile` file in releases, which should help
  distributions which package qutebrowser, as they can run something like
  `make -f misc/Makefile DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install` now.
- New fields for `window.title_format` and `tabs.title.format`:
  * `{current_url}`
  * `{protocol}`
- New settings:
  * `colors.statusbar.passthrough.fg`/`.bg`
  * `completion.delay` and `completion.min_chars` to update the completion less
    often.
  * `completion.use_best_match` to automatically use the best-matching
    command in the completion.
  * `keyhint.radius` to configure the edge rounding for the key hint widget.
  * `qt.highdpi` to turn on Qt's High-DPI scaling.
  * `tabs.pinned.shrink` (`true` by default) to make it possible
    for pinned tabs and normal tabs to have the same size.
  * `content.windowed_fullscreen` to show e.g. a fullscreened video in the
    window without fullscreening that window.
  * `tabs.persist_mode_on_change` to keep the current mode when
    switching tabs.
  * `session.lazy_restore` which allows to not load pages immediately
    when restoring a session.
- New commands:
  * `:tab-give` and `:tab-take`, to give tabs to another window, or take them
    from another window.
  * `:completion-item-yank` (bound to `<Ctrl-C>`) to yank the current
    completion item text.
  * `:edit-command` to edit the commandline in an editor.
  * `search.incremental` for incremental text search.
- New flags for existing commands:
  * `-o` flag for `:spawn` to show stdout/stderr in a new tab.
  * `--rapid` flag for `:command-accept` (bound to `Ctrl-Enter` by default),
    which allows executing a command in the completion without closing it.
  * `--private` and `--related` flags for `:edit-url`, which have the
    same effect they have with `:open`.
  * `--history` for `:completion-item-focus` which causes it to go
    through the command history when no text was entered. The default bindings for
    cursor keys in the completion changed to use that, so that they can be used
    again to navigate through completion items when a text was entered.
  * `--file` for `:debug-pyeval` which makes it take a filename instead of a
    line of code.
- New `config.source(...)` method for `config.py` to source another file.
- New `{line}` and `{column}` replacements for `editor.command` to position the
  cursor correctly.

- The `asciidoc2html.py` script now uses Pygments (which is already a dependency
  of qutebrowser) instead of `source-highlight` for syntax highlighting.
- The `:buffer` command now doesn't require quoting anymore, similar to `:open`.
- The `importer.py` script was largely rewritten and now also supports importing
  from Firefox' `places.sqlite` file and Chrome/Chromium profiles.
- Various internal refactorings to use Python 3.5 and ECMAscript 6 features.
- If the `window.hide_wayland_decoration` setting is False, but
  `QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION` is set in the environment,
  the decorations are still hidden.
- The `install_dict.py` script for QtWebEngine was renamed to `dictcli.py` and
  can now also upgrade dictionaries correctly.

  order, and mixed matches on URL/tite are possible.
- The system's default encoding (rather than UTF-8) is now used to decode
  subprocess output.
- qutebrowser now ensures it's focused again after an external editor is closed.
- The `colors.completion.fg` setting can now be a list, allowing to specify
  different colors for the three completion columns.

Fixed
~~~~~

- More consistent sizing for favicons with vertical tabs.
- Using `:home` on pinned tabs is now prevented.
- Fix crash with unknown file types loaded via `qute://help`.

[[v1.0.0]]
v1.0.0 (2017-10-12)
-------------------

Major changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Dependency changes:
  * Support for legacy QtWebKit (before 5.212 which is
    https://github.com/annulen/webkit/wiki[distributed independently from Qt])
    is dropped.
  * Support for Python 3.4 is dropped.
  * Support for Qt before 5.7.1 and PyQt before 5.7 is dropped.
  * New dependency on the QtSql module and Qt sqlite support.
  * New dependency on the https://www.attrs.org/[attrs] project (packaged as
    `python-attr` in some distributions).
  * The depedency on PyOpenGL (when using QtWebEngine) got removed. Note
    that PyQt5.QtOpenGL is still a dependency.
  * PyQt5.QtOpenGL is now always required, even with QtWebKit.
- The QtWebEngine backend is now used by default. Note this means that
  QtWebEngine now should be a required dependency, and QtWebKit (if new enough)
  should be changed to an optional dependency.
- Completely rewritten configuration system which ignores the old config file.
  See link:qute://help/configuring.html[] for details.
- Various documentation files got moved to the doc/ subfolder;
 `qutebrowser.desktop` got moved to misc/.
- `:set` now doesn't support toggling/cycling values anymore, that functionality
  got moved to `:config-cycle`.
- New completion engine based on sqlite, which allows to complete
  the entire browsing history. The default for
  `completion.web_history_max_items` got changed to `-1` (unlimited). If the
  completion is too slow on your machine, try setting it to a few 1000 items.
- Up/Down now navigates through the command history instead of selecting
  completion items. Either use Tab to cycle through the completion, or
  https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/help/configuring.asciidoc#migrating-older-configurations[restore the old behavior].

Added
~~~~~

- QtWebEngine: Spell checking support, see the `spellcheck.languages` setting.
- New `qt.args` setting to pass additional arguments to Qt/Chromium.
- New `backend` setting to select the backend to use.
  Together with the previous setting, this should make most wrapper scripts
  unnecessary.
- qutebrowser can now be set as the default browser on macOS.
- New config commands:
  * `:config-cycle` to cycle an option between multiple values.
  * `:config-unset` to remove a configured option.
  * `:config-clear` to remove all configured options.
  * `:config-source` to (re-)read a `config.py` file.
  * `:config-edit` to open the `config.py` file in an editor.
  * `:config-write-py` to write a `config.py` template file.
- New `:version` command which opens `qute://version`.
- New back/forward indicator in the statusbar.
- New `bindings.key_mappings` setting to map keys to other keys.
- QtWebEngine: Support for proxy authentication.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Using `:download` now uses the page's title as filename.
- Using `:back` or `:forward` with a count now skips intermediate pages.
- When there are multiple messages shown, the timeout is increased.
- `:search` now only clears the search if one was displayed before, so pressing
  `<Escape>` doesn't un-focus inputs anymore.
- Pinned tabs now adjust to their text's width, so the `tabs.width.pinned`
  setting got removed.
- `:set-cmd-text` now has a `--run-on-count` argument to run the underlying
  command directly if a count was given.
- `:scroll-perc` got renamed to `:scroll-to-perc`.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- Migrating QtWebEngine data written by versions before 2016-11-15 (before
  v0.9.0) is now not supported anymore.

Fixes
~~~~~

  restores the correct previous window state (maximized/fullscreen).
- When `input.insert_mode.auto_load` is set, background tabs now don't enter
  insert mode anymore.
- The keybinding help widget now works correctly when using keybindings with a
  count.

[[v0.9.0]]
v0.9.0 (2016-12-28)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- *New dependency:* qutebrowser now depends on the Qt QML module, which is

  downloads with (instead of e.g. `xdg-open` on Linux).
- Support for PAC (proxy autoconfig) with QtWebKit

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Hints are now drawn natively in Qt instead of using web elements. This has a
  few implications for users:
    * The `hints -> opacity` setting does not exist anymore, but you can use
      `rgba(r, g, b, alpha)` colors instead for `colors -> hints.bg`.
    * The `hints -> font` setting is not affected by
      `fonts -> web-family-fixed` anymore. Thus, a transformer got added to
      change `Monospace` to `${_monospace}`.
    * Gradients in hint colors can now be configured by using `qlineargradient`
      and friends instead of `-webkit-gradient`. The most common cases get
      migrated automatically, but if you drastically changed the defaults,
      you'll need to manually adjust your config.
    * Styling hints by styling `qutehint` elements in `user-stylesheet` was
      never officially supported and does not work anymore.
    * Hints are now not affected by the page's stylesheet or zoom anymore.
- `:bookmark-add` now has a `--toggle` flag which deletes the bookmark if it
  already exists.
- `:bookmark-load` now has a `--delete` flag which deletes the bookmark after
  loading it.
- `:open` now also accepts quickmark names instead of URLs
- `:tab-move` now optionally takes an index for absolute moving.
- Commands taking either an argument or a count (like `:zoom` or `:tab-focus`)
  now prefer the count instead of showing an error message.
- `:open` now has an `--implicit` argument to treat the opened tab as implicit
  (i.e. to open it at the position it would be opened if it was a clicked link)
- `:download-open` and `:prompt-open-download` now have an optional `cmdline`
  argument to pass a commandline to open the download with.
- `:yank` now has a position argument to select what to yank instead of using
  flags.
- Replacements like `{url}` can now also be used in the middle of an argument.
  Consequently, commands taking another command (`:later`, `:repeat` and
  `:bind`) now don't immediately evaluate variables.
- Tab titles in the `:buffer` completion now update correctly when a page's
  title is changed via javascript.
- `:hint` now has a `--mode <mode>` flag to override the hint mode configured
  using the `hints -> mode` setting.
- With `new-instance-open-target` set to a tab option, the tab is now opened in
  the most recently focused (instead of the last opened) window. This can be
  configured with the new `new-instance-open-target.window` setting.
  It can also be set to `last-visible` to show the pages in the most recently
  visible window, or `first-opened` to use the first (oldest) available window.
- Word hints now are more clever about getting the element text from some elements.
- Completions for `:help` and `:bind` now also show hidden commands
- The `:buffer` completion now also filters using the first column (id).
- `:undo` has been improved to reopen tabs at the position they were closed.
- `:navigate` now takes a count for `up`/`increment`/`decrement`.
- The `hints -> auto-follow` setting now can be set to
  `always`/`full-match`/`unique-match`/`never` to more precisely control when
  hints should be followed automatically.
- Counts can now be used with special keybindings (e.g. with modifiers).
  This was already implemented for v0.7.0 originally, but got reverted because
  it caused some issues and then never re-applied.
- Sending a command to an existing instance (via "qutebrowser :reload") now
  doesn't mark it as urgent anymore.
- `tabs -> title-format` now treats an empty string as valid.
- Bindings for `:`, `/` and `?` are now configured explicitly and not hardcoded
  anymore.
- The `completion -> show` setting can now be set to `always`, `auto` or
  `never`.
- `:open-editor` can now be used in any mode.
- Lots of improvements to and bugfixes for the QtWebEngine backend, such as
  working hints. However, using qutebrowser directly from git is still advised
  when using `--backend webengine`.
- `content -> javascript-can-open-windows` got renamed to
  `javascript-can-open-windows-automatically`.
- `:prompt-accept` now optionally accepts a value which overrides the one
  entered in the input box. `yes` and `no` can be used as values for yes/no
  questions.
- The new `--qt-arg` and `--qt-flag` arguments can be used to pass
  arguments/flags to Qt's commandline.
- Error/warning/info messages are now shown stacked above the statusbar.
  This also added various new settings:
    * `colors -> messages.fg.error` (renamed from `statusbar.fg.error`)
    * `colors -> messages.bg.error` (renamed from `statusbar.bg.error`)
    * `colors -> messages.border.error`
    * `colors -> messages.fg.warning` (renamed from `statusbar.fg.warning`)
    * `colors -> messages.bg.warning` (renamed from `statusbar.bg.warning`)
    * `colors -> messages.border.warning`
    * `colors -> messages.fg.info`
    * `colors -> messages.bg.info`
    * `colors -> messages.border.info`
    * `fonts -> messages.error`
    * `fonts -> messages.warning`
    * `fonts -> messages.info`
- The `qute:settings` page now also shows option descriptions.
- `qute:version` and `qutebrowser --version` now show various important paths
- `:spawn`/userscripts now show a nicer error when a script wasn't found
- Various functionality now works when javascript is disabled with QtWebKit
- Various commands/settings taking `left`/`right`/`previous` arguments now take
  `prev`/`next`/`last-used` to remove ambiguity.
- The `ui -> user-stylesheet` setting now only takes filenames, not CSS snippets
- `ui -> window-title-format` now has a new `{backend} ` replacement
- `:hint` has a new `--add-history` argument to add the URL to the history for
  yank/spawn targets.
- `:set` now cycles through values if more than one argument is given.
- `:open` now opens `default-page` without a URL even without `-t`/`-b`/`-w` given.

Deprecated

v0.8.0 (2016-07-26)
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- New `:repeat-command` command (mapped to `.`) to repeat the last command.
  Note that two former default bundings conflict with that binding, unbinding
  them via `:unbind .i` and `:unbind .o` is recommended.
- New `qute:bookmarks` page which displays all bookmarks and quickmarks.
- New `:prompt-open-download` (bound to `Ctrl-X`) which can be used to open a
  download directly when getting the filename prompt.
- New `{host}` replacement for tab- and window titles which evaluates
  to the current host.

  status bar (top/bottom).
- New `--pdf <filename>` argument for `:print` WHICH can be used to generate a
  PDF without a dialog.

Changed
~~~~~~~

Removed
~~~~~~~

- The ability to display status messages from webpages, as well as the related
  `ui ->  display-statusbar-messages` setting.
- The `general -> wrap-search` setting as searches now always wrap.
  According to a quick straw poll and prior crash logs, almost nobody is using
  `wrap-search = false`, and turning off wrapping is not possible with
  QtWebEngine.
- `:edit-url` now doesn't accept a count anymore as its behavior was confusing
  and it doesn't make much sense to add a count.

  following a hint when filtering in number mode.
- New `:history-clear` command to clear the entire history

- Number hints are now renumbered after filtering
- Number hints can now be filtered with multiple space-separated search terms
- `hints -> scatter` is now ignored for number hints
- Better history implementation which also stores titles.
  As a consequence, URLs which redirect to another URL are now added to the
  history too, marked with a `-r` suffix to the timestamp field.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Fixed using `:hint links spawn` with flags - you can now use things like the
  `-v` argument for `:spawn` or pass flags to the spawned commands.

-------------------

Added
~~~~~

  key by default for existing users due to a conflict with the `gt`/`gT`
  bindings (which are now removed from the default bindings).
  You can bind it by hand by running `:bind -f gt set-cmd-text -s :buffer`.

- Improved performance when scrolling with many tabs open.
- Shift-Insert now also pastes primary selection for prompts.
- `:download-remove --all` got un-deprecated to provide symmetry with

- New bindings `<Ctrl-R>` (rapid), `<Ctrl-F>` (foreground) and `<Ctrl-B>` (background) to switch hint modes while hinting.
- `<Ctrl-M>` and numpad-enter are now bound by default for bindings where `<Return>` was bound.
- `:hint tab` and `F` now respect the `background-tabs` setting. To enforce a foreground tab (what `F` did before), use `:hint tab-fg` or `;f`.
- `:scroll` now takes a direction argument (`up`/`down`/`left`/`right`/`top`/`bottom`/`page-up`/`page-down`) instead of two pixel arguments (`dx`/`dy`). The old form still works but is deprecated.
- The `ui -> user-stylesheet` setting now also takes file paths relative to the config directory.
- The `content -> cookies-accept` setting now has new `no-3rdparty` (default) and `no-unknown-3rdparty` values to block third-party cookies. The `default` value got renamed to `all`.
- Improved startup time by reading the webpage history while qutebrowser is open.
- The way `:spawn` splits its commandline has been changed slightly to allow commands with flags.
- The default for the `new-instance-open-target` setting has been changed to `tab`.
- Sessions now store zoom/scroll-position separately for each entry.

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- `:scroll` with two pixel-arguments is now deprecated - `:scroll-px` should be used instead.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- New `-f` argument to `:bind` to overwrite the old binding.
- New `--qt-name` argument to qutebrowser which is passed to Qt to set `WM_CLASS`.
- Alternating row colors in completion. This adds a new `colors -> completion.alternate-bg` option.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Ignore quotes with maxsplit-commands (`:open`, `:quickmark-load`, etc.) and don't quote arguments for those commands in the completions. This also means some commands needed adjustments:
    * Clear search when `:search` without arguments is given.  (`:search ""` will now search for the literal text `""`)
    * Add `-s`/`--space` argument to `:set-cmd-text` (as `:set-cmd-text "foo "` will now set the literal text `"foo "`)
- Ignore `;;` for splitting with some commands like `:bind`.
- Add unbound (new) default keybindings to config. This also adds a new `<unbound>` special command.
    * To unbind a command keybinding without binding it to a new key, you now have to bind it to `<unbound>` or it'll be readded automatically.
- If an SSL error is raised multiple times with the same error/certificate/host/scheme/port, the user is only asked once.
- Jump to last instead of first item when pressing Shift-Tab the first time in the completion.
- Add a fullscreen keybinding.
- Add a `:search` command in addition to `/foo` so it's more visible and can be used from scripts.

- Clone tab icon, tab text and zoom level when cloning tabs.
- Don't open relative file paths with `:open`, only with commandline arguments.
- Expand environment variables in config settings which take a file path.
- Add a list of common user agents to the user agent setting completion.
- Move cursor to end of textboxes when hinting.
- Don't start searches on invalid URLs for quickmarks/startpage.
- Various performance improvements for the completion.
- Always open URLs given as argument in the foreground.
- Improve various error messages.
- Add `startpage`/`default-page` values to `tabs -> last-close`.
- Various improvements to `:restart` - it should be more robust now and uses sessions so all state (focused tab, scroll position, etc.) gets remembered.
- Add tab index display to the statusbar.
- Keep progress bar height fixed when the statusbar is multiline.
- Many improvements to tests and related infrastructure:
    * `init_venv.py` and `run_checks.py` have been replaced by https://tox.readthedocs.org/[tox]. Install tox and run `tox -e mkvenv` instead.
    * The tests now use https://pytest.org/[pytest]
    * Many new tests added
    * Mac Mini buildbot to run the tests on macOS.
    * Coverage recording via https://coverage.readthedocs.io/[coverage.py].
