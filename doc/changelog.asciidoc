-------------------

Added
~~~~~

- The qute-pass userscript now has optional OTP support.
- When `:spawn --userscript` is called with a count, that count is now
  passed to userscripts as `$QUTE_COUNT`.
- New `content.mouse_lock` setting to handle HTML5 pointer locking.
- New `completion.web_history.exclude` setting which hides a list of URL
  patterns from the completion.
- Rewritten PDF.js support:
  * PDF.js support and the `content.pdfjs` setting are now available with
    QtWebEngine.
  * Opening a PDF file now doesn't start a second request anymore.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The `:repeat` command now takes a count which is multiplied with the given
  "times" argument.
- The default keybinding to leave passthrough mode was changed from `<Ctrl-V>`
  to `<Shift-Escape>`, which makes pasting from the clipboard easier in
  passthrough mode and is also unlikely to conflict with webpage bindings.
- The `app_id` is now set to `qutebrowser` for Wayland.
- `Command` or `Cmd` can now be used (instead of `Meta`) to map the Command key
  on macOS.
- Using `:set option` now shows the value of the setting (like `:set option?`
  already did).
- The `completion.web_history_max_items` setting got renamed to
  `completion.web_history.max_items`.
- The Makefile shipped with qutebrowser now supports overriding variables
  DATADIR and MANDIR.
- Various performance improvements when many tabs are opened.
- Regenerating completion history now shows a progress dialog.
- Make qute:// pages work properly on Qt 5.11.2
- The `content.autoplay` setting now supports URL patterns on Qt >= 5.11.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Error when passing a substring with spaces to `:tab-take`.
- Greasemonkey scripts which start with an UTF-8 BOM are now handled correctly.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- Support for importing pre-v1.0.0 history files has been removed.

v1.4.2
------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- The `content.xss_auditing` setting is now enabled by default, to mirror
  Chromium's rather than Qt's default behavior.
- Long URLs in the statusbar are now elided at the end rather than in the
  middle, to make sure the hostname is completely visible whenever possible.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Crash in Qt 5.7.1 when a website uses `window.print()`.
- The workaround for Nouveau graphic drivers now works properly again.
- Crash when using `:follow-selected` with a link which is outside of the view.
- Workaround for windows not showing as urgent with some window managers
  (like i3).
- Crash when opening URLs with some unicode characters (IDNA 2008). Those URLs
  still won't open though, due to missing support in Qt.
- Crash when a download directory which can't be created is configured.
- Crash in the `importer.py` script when importing Chrome bookmarks from newer Chrome versions.
- The `content.webrtc_public_interfaces_only` option didn't work on Qt 5.11 previously (it now does).
  Note it still does not work on Qt 5.10 (due to a Qt bug) and Qt < 5.9.2.
- Repeated escaping of entries in `qute://log` when refreshing page.
- The host blocker doesn't block 0.0.0.0 anymore.
- Crash when using :// as URL pattern.

v1.4.1
------

Security
~~~~~~~~

- CVE-2018-10895: Fix CSRF issue on the qute://settings page, leading to
  possible arbitrary code execution. See the related GitHub issue for details:

Fixed
~~~~~

- Rare crash when an error occurs in downloads.
- Newlines are now stripped from the :version pastebin URL.
- There's a new `mkvenv-pypi-old` environment in `tox.ini` which installs an
  older Qt, which is needed on Ubuntu 16.04.
- Worked around a Qt issue which redirects to a `chrome-error://` page when
  trying to use U2F.
- The `link_pyqt.py` script now works correctly with PyQt 5.11.
- The Windows installer now uninstalls the old version before installing the
  new one, fixing issues with qutebrowser not starting after installing v1.4.0
  over v1.3.3.

  * Support for requesting persistent storage via
    `navigator.webkitPersistentStorage.requestQuota` with a new
    `content.persistent_storage` setting (requires Qt 5.11).
    This setting also supports URL patterns.
  * Support for registering custom protocol handlers via
    `navigator.registerProtocolHandler` with a new
    `content.register_protocol_handler` setting (requires Qt 5.11).
    This setting also supports URL patterns.
  * Support for WebRTC screen sharing with a new `content.desktop_capture`
    setting (requires Qt 5.10).

- Deleting history items via `:history-clear` or `:completion-item-del` now
  also removes that URL from QtWebEngine's visited links.
- There's now completion for commands taking a variable count of arguments
  (like `:config-cycle`).
- QtWebEngine: On Qt 5.11.1, no reloads are needed anymore when switching
  between pages with changed settings (e.g. `content.javascript.enabled`).
- The `qt.force_software_rendering` setting changed from a boolean to taking
  different values (`software-opengl`, `qt-quick` and `chromium`) for different
  kinds of software rendering workarounds.
- On Qt 5.11, using wayland with QtWebEngine is now possible when using
  software rendering.
- GreaseMonkey scripts now get their own global scope (based on the page's
  one), which allows scripts like OneeChan to work.
- Rapid hinting is now supported with the `yank` and `yank-primary` targets,
  copying newline-separated links.
- QtWebEngine: On Qt 5.11, the developer tools (inspector) can now be used
  securely and without requiring the `--enable-webengine-inspector` option.
- The `<Enter>` key (`:follow-selected`) now follows the currently focused
  element if there's no selection.
- The `--logfilter` argument now can be prepended with an exclamation mark
  (e.g. `--logfilter '!init,destroy'`) to invert the filter.
- `:view-source` now has a `--pygments` flag which uses the "old" way of
  rendering sources even with QtWebEngine.
- Improved error messages when a setting needs a newer Qt version.
- QtWebEngine: Various improvements to make the cursor more visible in caret
  browsing.
- When a prompt is opened in insert/passthrough mode, the mode is restored
  after closing the prompt.
- On Qt 5.10 or newer, dictionaries are now read from the qutebrowser data
  directory (e.g. `~/.local/share/qutebrowser`) instead of `/usr/share/qt`.
  Existing dictionaries are copied over.
- If an error while parsing `~/.netrc` occurs, the cause of the error is now
  logged.
- On Qt 5.9 or newer, certificate errors now show Chromium's detailed error
  page.
- Greasemonkey scripts now support a "@qute-js-world" tag to run them in a
  different JavaScript context.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Various subtle keyboard focus issues.
- The security fix in v1.3.3 caused URLs with ampersands
  (`www.example.com?one=1&two=2`) to send the wrong arguments when clicked on
  the `qute://history` page.
- Crash when opening a PDF page with PDF.js enabled (on QtWebKit), but no
  PDF.js installed.
- Crash when closing a tab shortly after opening it.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- No prebuilt binaries for 32-bit Windows are supplied anymore. This is due to
  Qt removing QtWebEngine support for those upstream. It might be possible to
  distribute 32-bit binaries again with Qt 5.12 in December, but that will only
  happen if it turns out enough people actually need 32-bit support.
- `:tab-detach` which has been deprecated in v1.1.0 has been removed.
- The `content.developer_extras` setting got removed. On QtWebKit, developer
  extras are now automatically enabled when opening the inspector.

v1.3.3
------

Security
~~~~~~~~

- An XSS vulnerability on the `qute://history` page allowed websites to inject
  HTML into the page via a crafted title tag. This could allow them to steal
  your browsing history. If you're currently unable to upgrade, avoid using
  `:history`. A CVE request for this issue is pending, see
  https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/4011[#4011] for updates.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Crash in a workaround for a Qt 5.11 bug in rare circumstances.
- Workaround for a Qt bug which preserves searches between page loads.
- In v1.3.2 a dependency on the `PyQt5.QtQuickWidgets` module was accidentally
  introduced. Since that module isn't packaged everywhere, it's been removed
  again.

v1.3.2
------

Fixed
~~~~~

- QtWebEngine: Improved workaround for a bug in Qt 5.11 where only the
  top/bottom half of the window is used.
- QtWebEngine: Work around a bug in Qt 5.11 where an endless loading-loop is
  triggered when clicking a link with an unknown scheme.
- QtWebEngine: When switching between pages with changed settings, less
  unnecessary reloads are done now.
- QtWebEngine: It's now possible to open external links such as `magnet://` or
  `mailto:` via hints.

v1.3.1
------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Work around a bug in Qt 5.11 where only the top/bottom half of the window is used.
  This workaround is incomplete, but fixes the majority of the cases where this happens.
- Work around keyboard focus issues with Qt 5.11.
- Work around an issue in Qt 5.11 where e.g. activating JavaScript per-domain
  needed a manual reload in some cases.
- Don't crash when a ² key is pressed (e.g. on AZERTY keyboards).
- Don't crash when a tab is opened and quickly closed again.


v1.3.0
------

Added
~~~~~

- New `:scroll-to-anchor` command to scroll to an anchor in the document.
- New `url.open_base_url` option to open the base URL of a searchengine when no
  search term is given.
- New `tabs.min_width` setting to configure the minimal width for tabs.
- New userscripts:
  * `getbib` to download bibtex information for DOIs on a page.
  * `qute-keepass` to get passwords from KeePassX.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- QtWebEngine: Support for JavaScript Shared Web Workers have been disabled on
  Qt versions older than 5.11 because of security issues in in Chromium.
  You can get the same effect in earlier versions via
  `:set qt.args ['disable-shared-workers']`. An equivalent workaround is also
  contained in Qt 5.9.5 and 5.10.1.
- The file dialog for downloads now has basic tab completion based on the
  entered text.
- `:version` now shows OS information for POSIX OS other than Linux/macOS.
- When there's an error inserting the text from an external editor, a backup
  file is now saved.
- The `window.hide_wayland_decoration` setting got renamed to
  `window.hide_decoration` and now also works outside of wayland.
- The `tabs.favicons.show` setting now can take three values: `'always'` (was
  `True`), `'never'` (was `False`) and `'pinned'` (to only show favicons for
  pinned tabs).
- Hover tooltips on tabs now always show the webpage's title.
- The default value for `content.host_blocking.lists` was changed to only
  include https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts[Steven Black's hosts-list] which
  combines various sources.
- Error messages when trying to wrap when `tabs.wrap` is `False` are now logged
  to debug instead of messages.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Using hints before a page is fully loaded is now possible again.
- Selecting hints with the number keypad now works again.
- Tab titles for tabs loaded from sessions should now really be correct instead
  of showing the URL.
- Loading URLs with customized settings from a session now avoids an additional
  reload.
- The window icon and title now get set correctly again.
- The `tabs.switching_delay` setting now has a correct maximum value limit set.

- The keyhint widget now shows the correct text for chained modifiers.
- Loading GreaseMonkey scripts now also works with Jinja2 2.8 (e.g. on Debian
  Stable).
- Adding styles with GreaseMonkey on fast sites now works properly.
- Window ID 0 is now excluded properly from `:tab-take` completion.
- A rare crash when cancelling a download has been fixed.
- The Makefile (intended for packagers) now supports `PREFIX` properly.
- The workaround for a black window with Nvidia graphics is now enabled on
  non-Linux systems (like FreeBSD) as well.
- Initial support for Qt 5.11.
- Checking for a new version after sending a crash report now works properly
  again.
- `@match` in Greasemonkey scripts now more closely matches the proper pattern
  syntax.
- Searching via `/` or `?` now doesn't handle any characters in a special way.
- Fixed crash when trying to retry some failed downloads on QtWebEngine.
- An invalid spellcheck dictionary filename now doesn't crash anymore.
- When no spellcheck dictionaries are configured, it's now disabled internally.
  This works around an issue with entering special characters on Facebook
  messenger.
- The macOS release now should work again on macOS 10.11 and newer.

v1.2.1
------

Fixed
~~~~~

- qutebrowser now starts properly when the PyQt5 QOpenGLFunctions package wasn't
  found.
- The keybinding cheatsheet on the quickstart page is now loaded from a local
  `qute://` URL again.
- With "tox -e mkvenv-pypi", PyQt 5.10.0 is used again instead of Qt 5.10.1,
  because of an issue with Qt 5.10.1 which causes qutebrowser to fail to start
  ("Could not find QtWebEngineProcess").

- Titles are now displayed correctly again for tabs which are cloned or loaded
  from sessions.
- Shortcuts now correctly use `Ctrl` instead of `Command` on macOS again.

v1.2.0
------

Added
~~~~~

- Initial implementation of per-domain settings:
  * `:set` and `:config-cycle` now have a `-u`/`--pattern` argument taking a
    https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns[URL match pattern]
    for supported settings.
  * `config.set` in `config.py` now takes a third argument which is the pattern.
  * New `with config.pattern('...') as p:` context manager for `config.py` to
    use the shorthand syntax with a pattern.
  * New `tsh` keybinding to toggle scripts for the current host. With a capital
    `S`, the toggle is saved. With a capital `H`, subdomains are included. With
    `u` instead of `h`, the exact current URL is used.
  * New `tph` keybinding to toggle plugins, with the same additional binding
    described above.
- New QtWebEngine features:
  * Caret/visual mode
  * Authentication via ~/.netrc
  * Retrying downloads with Qt 5.10 or newer
  * Hinting and other features inside same-origin frames
- New flags for existing commands:
  * `:session-load` has a new `--delete` flag which deletes the
    session after loading it.
  * New `--no-last` flag for `:tab-focus` to not focus the last tab when focusing
    the currently focused one.
  * New `--edit` flag for `:view-source` to open the source in an external editor.
  * New `--select` flag for `:follow-hint` which acts like the given string was entered but doesn't necessary follow the hint.
- New special pages:
  * `qute://bindings` (opened via `:bind`) which shows all keybindings.
  * `qute://tabs` (opened via `:buffer`) which lists all tabs.
- New settings:
  * `statusbar.widgets` to configure which widgets should be shown in which
    order in the statusbar.
  * `tabs.mode_on_change` which replaces `tabs.persist_mode_on_change`. It can
    now be set to `restore` which remembers input modes (input/passthrough)
    per tab.
  * `input.insert_mode.auto_enter` which makes it possible to disable entering
    insert mode automatically when an editable element was clicked. Together
    with `input.forward_unbound_keys`, this should allow for emacs-like
    "modeless" keybindings.
- New `:prompt-yank` command (bound to `Alt-y` by default) to yank URLs
  referenced in prompts.
- The `hostblock_blame` script which was removed in v1.0 was updated for the new
  config and re-added.
- New `cycle-inputs.js` script in `scripts/` which can be used with `:jseval -f`
  to cycle through inputs.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Complete refactoring of key input handling, with various effects:
  * emacs-like keychains such as `<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-C>` can now be bound.
  * Key chains can now be bound in any mode (this allows binding unused keys in
    hint mode).
  * Yes/no prompts don't use keybindings from the `prompt` section anymore, they
    have their own `yesno` section instead.
  * Trying to bind invalid keys now shows an error.
  * The `bindings.default` setting can now only be set in a `config.py`, and
    existing values in `autoconfig.yml` are ignored.
- Improvements for GreaseMonkey support:
  * `@include` and `@exclude` now support regex matches. With QtWebEngine and Qt
    5.8 and newer, Qt handles the matching, but similar functionality will be
    added in Qt 5.11.
  * Support for `@requires`
  * Support for the GreaseMonkey 4.0 API
- The sqlite history now uses write-ahead logging which should be
  a performance and stability improvement.
- When an editor is spawned with `:open-editor` and `:config-edit`, the changes
  are now applied as soon as the file is saved in the editor.
- The `hist_importer.py` script now only imports URL schemes qutebrowser can
  handle.
- Deleting a prefix (`:`, `/` or `?`) via backspace now leaves command mode.
- Angular 1 elements and `<summary>`/`<details>` now get hints assigned.
- `:tab-only` with pinned tabs now still closes unpinned tabs.
- The `url.incdec_segments` option now also can take `port` as possible segment.
- QtWebEngine: `:view-source` now uses Chromium's `view-source:` scheme.
- Tabs now show their full title as tooltip.
- When there are multiple unknown keys in a autoconfig.yml, they now all get
  reported in one error.
- More performance improvements when opening/closing many tabs.
- The `:version` page now has a button to pastebin the information.
- Replacements like `{url}` can now be escaped as `{{url}}`.

Fixed
~~~~~

- QtWebEngine bugfixes:
  * Improved fullscreen handling with Qt 5.10.
  * Hinting and scrolling now works properly on special `view-source:` pages.
  * Scroll positions are now restored correctly from sessions.
  * `:follow-selected` should now work in more cases with Qt > 5.10.
  * Incremental search now flickers less and doesn't move to the second result
    when pressing Enter.
  * Keys like `Ctrl-V` or `Shift-Insert` are now correctly handled/filtered with
    Qt 5.10.
  * Fixed hangs/segfaults on exit with Qt 5.10.1.
  * Fixed favicons sometimes getting cleared with Qt 5.10.
  * Qt download objects are now cleaned up properly when a download is removed.
  * JavaScript messages are now not double-HTML escaped anymore on Qt < 5.11
- QtWebKit bugfixes:
  * Fixed GreaseMonkey-related crashes.
  * `:view-source` now displays a valid URL.
- URLs containing ampersands and other special chars are now shown correctly
  when filtering them in the completion.
- `:bookmark-add "" foo` can now be used to save the current URL with a custom
  title.
- `:spawn -o` now waits until the process has finished before trying to show the
  output. Previously, it incorrectly showed the previous output immediately.
- Suspended pages now should always load the correct page when being un-suspended.
- Exception types are now shown properly with `:config-source` and `:config-edit`.
- When using `:bookmark-add --toggle`, bookmarks are now saved properly.
- Crash when opening an invalid URL from an application on macOS.
- Crash with an empty `completion.timestamp_format`.
- Crash when `completion.min_chars` is set in some cases.
- HTML/JS resource files are now read into RAM on start to avoid crashes when
  changing qutebrowser versions while it's open.
- Setting `bindings.key_mappings` to an empty value is now allowed.
- Bindings to an empty commands are now ignored rather than crashing.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- `QUTE_SELECTED_HTML` is now not set for userscripts anymore except when called
  via hints.
- The `qutebrowser_viewsource` userscript has been removed as
  `:view-source --edit` can now be used.

  `tabs.mode_on_change`.

v1.1.2
------

Changed
~~~~~~~

  Chromium up to version 64.0.3282.140.

Fixed
~~~~~

- QtWebEngine: Crash with Qt 5.10.1 when using :undo on some tabs.
- Compatibility with Python 3.7

v1.1.1
------

Fixed
~~~~~

- The Makefile now actually works.
- Fixed crashes with Qt 5.10 when closing a tab before it finished loading.

v1.1.0
------

Added
~~~~~

- Initial support for Greasemonkey scripts. There are still some rough edges,
  but many scripts should already work.
- There's now a `misc/Makefile` file in releases, which should help
  distributions which package qutebrowser, as they can run something like
  `make -f misc/Makefile DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install` now.
- New fields for `window.title_format` and `tabs.title.format`:
  * `{current_url}`
  * `{protocol}`
- New settings:
  * `colors.statusbar.passthrough.fg`/`.bg`
  * `completion.delay` and `completion.min_chars` to update the completion less
    often.
  * `completion.use_best_match` to automatically use the best-matching
    command in the completion.
  * `keyhint.radius` to configure the edge rounding for the key hint widget.
  * `qt.highdpi` to turn on Qt's High-DPI scaling.
  * `tabs.pinned.shrink` (`true` by default) to make it possible
    for pinned tabs and normal tabs to have the same size.
  * `content.windowed_fullscreen` to show e.g. a fullscreened video in the
    window without fullscreening that window.
  * `tabs.persist_mode_on_change` to keep the current mode when
    switching tabs.
  * `session.lazy_restore` which allows to not load pages immediately
    when restoring a session.
- New commands:
  * `:tab-give` and `:tab-take`, to give tabs to another window, or take them
    from another window.
  * `:completion-item-yank` (bound to `<Ctrl-C>`) to yank the current
    completion item text.
  * `:edit-command` to edit the commandline in an editor.
  * `search.incremental` for incremental text search.
- New flags for existing commands:
  * `-o` flag for `:spawn` to show stdout/stderr in a new tab.
  * `--rapid` flag for `:command-accept` (bound to `Ctrl-Enter` by default),
    which allows executing a command in the completion without closing it.
  * `--private` and `--related` flags for `:edit-url`, which have the
    same effect they have with `:open`.
  * `--history` for `:completion-item-focus` which causes it to go
    through the command history when no text was entered. The default bindings for
    cursor keys in the completion changed to use that, so that they can be used
    again to navigate through completion items when a text was entered.
  * `--file` for `:debug-pyeval` which makes it take a filename instead of a
    line of code.
- New `config.source(...)` method for `config.py` to source another file.
- New `{line}` and `{column}` replacements for `editor.command` to position the
  cursor correctly.
- New `qute-pass` userscript as alternative to `password_fill` which allows
  selecting accounts via rofi or any other dmenu-compatile application.
- New `hist_importer.py` script to import history from Firefox/Chromium.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Some settings got renamed:
  * `tabs.width.bar` -> `tabs.width`
  * `tabs.width.indicator` -> `tabs.indicator.width`
  * `tabs.indicator_padding` -> `tabs.indicator.padding`
  * `session_default_name` -> `session.default_name`
  * `ignore_case` -> `search.ignore_case`
- Much improved user stylesheet handling for QtWebEngine which reduces
  flickering and updates immediately after setting a stylesheet.
- High-DPI favicons are now used when available.
- The `asciidoc2html.py` script now uses Pygments (which is already a dependency
  of qutebrowser) instead of `source-highlight` for syntax highlighting.
- The `:buffer` command now doesn't require quoting anymore, similar to `:open`.

------

Major changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Dependency changes:
  * Support for legacy QtWebKit (before 5.212 which is
    https://github.com/annulen/webkit/wiki[distributed independently from Qt])
    is dropped.
  * Support for Python 3.4 is dropped.
  * Support for Qt before 5.7.1 and PyQt before 5.7 is dropped.
  * New dependency on the QtSql module and Qt sqlite support.
  * New dependency on the http://www.attrs.org/[attrs] project (packaged as
    `python-attr` in some distributions).
  * The depedency on PyOpenGL (when using QtWebEngine) got removed. Note
    that PyQt5.QtOpenGL is still a dependency.
  * PyQt5.QtOpenGL is now always required, even with QtWebKit.
- The QtWebEngine backend is now used by default. Note this means that
  QtWebEngine now should be a required dependency, and QtWebKit (if new enough)
  should be changed to an optional dependency.
- Completely rewritten configuration system which ignores the old config file.
  See link:qute://help/configuring.html[] for details.
- Various documentation files got moved to the doc/ subfolder;
 `qutebrowser.desktop` got moved to misc/.
- `:set` now doesn't support toggling/cycling values anymore, that functionality
  got moved to `:config-cycle`.
- New completion engine based on sqlite, which allows to complete
  the entire browsing history. The default for
  `completion.web_history_max_items` got changed to `-1` (unlimited). If the
  completion is too slow on your machine, try setting it to a few 1000 items.
- Up/Down now navigates through the command history instead of selecting
  completion items. Either use Tab to cycle through the completion, or
  https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/help/configuring.asciidoc#migrating-older-configurations[restore the old behavior].

Added
~~~~~

- QtWebEngine: Spell checking support, see the `spellcheck.languages` setting.
- New `qt.args` setting to pass additional arguments to Qt/Chromium.
- New `backend` setting to select the backend to use.
  Together with the previous setting, this should make most wrapper scripts
  unnecessary.
- qutebrowser can now be set as the default browser on macOS.
- New config commands:
  * `:config-cycle` to cycle an option between multiple values.
  * `:config-unset` to remove a configured option.
  * `:config-clear` to remove all configured options.
  * `:config-source` to (re-)read a `config.py` file.
  * `:config-edit` to open the `config.py` file in an editor.
  * `:config-write-py` to write a `config.py` template file.
- New `:version` command which opens `qute://version`.
- New back/forward indicator in the statusbar.
- New `bindings.key_mappings` setting to map keys to other keys.
- QtWebEngine: Support for proxy authentication.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Using `:download` now uses the page's title as filename.
- Using `:back` or `:forward` with a count now skips intermediate pages.
- When there are multiple messages shown, the timeout is increased.
- `:search` now only clears the search if one was displayed before, so pressing
  `<Escape>` doesn't un-focus inputs anymore.
- Pinned tabs now adjust to their text's width, so the `tabs.width.pinned`
  setting got removed.
- `:set-cmd-text` now has a `--run-on-count` argument to run the underlying
  command directly if a count was given.
- `:scroll-perc` got renamed to `:scroll-to-perc`.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- Migrating QtWebEngine data written by versions before 2016-11-15 (before
  v0.9.0) is now not supported anymore.

Fixes
~~~~~

Added
~~~~~

- *New dependency:* qutebrowser now depends on the Qt QML module, which is

  downloads with (instead of e.g. `xdg-open` on Linux).
- Support for PAC (proxy autoconfig) with QtWebKit

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Hints are now drawn natively in Qt instead of using web elements. This has a
  few implications for users:
    * The `hints -> opacity` setting does not exist anymore, but you can use
      `rgba(r, g, b, alpha)` colors instead for `colors -> hints.bg`.
    * The `hints -> font` setting is not affected by
      `fonts -> web-family-fixed` anymore. Thus, a transformer got added to
      change `Monospace` to `${_monospace}`.
    * Gradients in hint colors can now be configured by using `qlineargradient`
      and friends instead of `-webkit-gradient`. The most common cases get
      migrated automatically, but if you drastically changed the defaults,
      you'll need to manually adjust your config.
    * Styling hints by styling `qutehint` elements in `user-stylesheet` was
      never officially supported and does not work anymore.
    * Hints are now not affected by the page's stylesheet or zoom anymore.
- `:bookmark-add` now has a `--toggle` flag which deletes the bookmark if it
  already exists.
- `:bookmark-load` now has a `--delete` flag which deletes the bookmark after
  loading it.
- `:open` now also accepts quickmark names instead of URLs
- `:tab-move` now optionally takes an index for absolute moving.
- Commands taking either an argument or a count (like `:zoom` or `:tab-focus`)
  now prefer the count instead of showing an error message.
- `:open` now has an `--implicit` argument to treat the opened tab as implicit
  (i.e. to open it at the position it would be opened if it was a clicked link)
- `:download-open` and `:prompt-open-download` now have an optional `cmdline`
  argument to pass a commandline to open the download with.
- `:yank` now has a position argument to select what to yank instead of using
  flags.
- Replacements like `{url}` can now also be used in the middle of an argument.
  Consequently, commands taking another command (`:later`, `:repeat` and
  `:bind`) now don't immediately evaluate variables.
- Tab titles in the `:buffer` completion now update correctly when a page's
  title is changed via javascript.
- `:hint` now has a `--mode <mode>` flag to override the hint mode configured
  using the `hints -> mode` setting.
- With `new-instance-open-target` set to a tab option, the tab is now opened in
  the most recently focused (instead of the last opened) window. This can be
  configured with the new `new-instance-open-target.window` setting.
  It can also be set to `last-visible` to show the pages in the most recently
  visible window, or `first-opened` to use the first (oldest) available window.
- Word hints now are more clever about getting the element text from some elements.
- Completions for `:help` and `:bind` now also show hidden commands
- The `:buffer` completion now also filters using the first column (id).
- `:undo` has been improved to reopen tabs at the position they were closed.
- `:navigate` now takes a count for `up`/`increment`/`decrement`.
- The `hints -> auto-follow` setting now can be set to
  `always`/`full-match`/`unique-match`/`never` to more precisely control when
  hints should be followed automatically.
- Counts can now be used with special keybindings (e.g. with modifiers).
  This was already implemented for v0.7.0 originally, but got reverted because
  it caused some issues and then never re-applied.
- Sending a command to an existing instance (via "qutebrowser :reload") now
  doesn't mark it as urgent anymore.
- `tabs -> title-format` now treats an empty string as valid.
- Bindings for `:`, `/` and `?` are now configured explicitly and not hardcoded
  anymore.
- The `completion -> show` setting can now be set to `always`, `auto` or
  `never`.
- `:open-editor` can now be used in any mode.
- Lots of improvements to and bugfixes for the QtWebEngine backend, such as
  working hints. However, using qutebrowser directly from git is still advised
  when using `--backend webengine`.
- `content -> javascript-can-open-windows` got renamed to
  `javascript-can-open-windows-automatically`.
- `:prompt-accept` now optionally accepts a value which overrides the one
  entered in the input box. `yes` and `no` can be used as values for yes/no
  questions.
- The new `--qt-arg` and `--qt-flag` arguments can be used to pass
  arguments/flags to Qt's commandline.
- Error/warning/info messages are now shown stacked above the statusbar.
  This also added various new settings:
    * `colors -> messages.fg.error` (renamed from `statusbar.fg.error`)
    * `colors -> messages.bg.error` (renamed from `statusbar.bg.error`)
    * `colors -> messages.border.error`
    * `colors -> messages.fg.warning` (renamed from `statusbar.fg.warning`)

  `ui ->  display-statusbar-messages` setting.
- The `general -> wrap-search` setting as searches now always wrap.
  According to a quick straw poll and prior crash logs, almost nobody is using
  `wrap-search = false`, and turning off wrapping is not possible with
  QtWebEngine.
- `:edit-url` now doesn't accept a count anymore as its behavior was confusing

  following a hint when filtering in number mode.
- New `:history-clear` command to clear the entire history

  As a consequence, URLs which redirect to another URL are now added to the
  history too, marked with a `-r` suffix to the timestamp field.

------

Added
~~~~~

- New `:buffer` command to easily switch tabs by name. This is not bound to a

- *Breaking change for userscripts:* `QUTE_HTML` and `QUTE_TEXT` for userscripts now don't store the contents directly, and instead contain a filename.
- The `content -> geolocation` and `notifications` settings now support a `true` value to always allow those. However, this is *not recommended*.
- New bindings `<Ctrl-R>` (rapid), `<Ctrl-F>` (foreground) and `<Ctrl-B>` (background) to switch hint modes while hinting.
- `<Ctrl-M>` and numpad-enter are now bound by default for bindings where `<Return>` was bound.
- `:hint tab` and `F` now respect the `background-tabs` setting. To enforce a foreground tab (what `F` did before), use `:hint tab-fg` or `;f`.
- `:scroll` now takes a direction argument (`up`/`down`/`left`/`right`/`top`/`bottom`/`page-up`/`page-down`) instead of two pixel arguments (`dx`/`dy`). The old form still works but is deprecated.
- The `ui -> user-stylesheet` setting now also takes file paths relative to the config directory.
- The `content -> cookies-accept` setting now has new `no-3rdparty` (default) and `no-unknown-3rdparty` values to block third-party cookies. The `default` value got renamed to `all`.
- Improved startup time by reading the webpage history while qutebrowser is open.
- The way `:spawn` splits its commandline has been changed slightly to allow commands with flags.
- The default for the `new-instance-open-target` setting has been changed to `tab`.
- Sessions now store zoom/scroll-position separately for each entry.

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- `:scroll` with two pixel-arguments is now deprecated - `:scroll-px` should be used instead.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- The `--no-crash-dialog` argument which was intended for debugging only was removed as it's replaced by `--no-err-windows` which suppresses all error windows.
- Support for Qt installations without SSL support was dropped.

- Two new options to customize the behavior of hints:
    * `hints -> min-chars` to set minimum number of chars in hints.
    * `hints -> scatter` which when turned off distributes the hints sequentially (like dwb) instead of scattering their positions (like Vimium).
- Make it possible to use `:open -[twb]` without url.
    * New option `general -> default-page` to set the page to be opened when doing that.

- New `-f` argument to `:bind` to overwrite the old binding.
- New `--qt-name` argument to qutebrowser which is passed to Qt to set `WM_CLASS`.
- Alternating row colors in completion. This adds a new `colors -> completion.alternate-bg` option.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Ignore quotes with maxsplit-commands (`:open`, `:quickmark-load`, etc.) and don't quote arguments for those commands in the completions. This also means some commands needed adjustments:
    * Clear search when `:search` without arguments is given.  (`:search ""` will now search for the literal text `""`)
    * Add `-s`/`--space` argument to `:set-cmd-text` (as `:set-cmd-text "foo "` will now set the literal text `"foo "`)
- Ignore `;;` for splitting with some commands like `:bind`.
- Add unbound (new) default keybindings to config. This also adds a new `<unbound>` special command.
    * To unbind a command keybinding without binding it to a new key, you now have to bind it to `<unbound>` or it'll be readded automatically.
- If an SSL error is raised multiple times with the same error/certificate/host/scheme/port, the user is only asked once.
- Jump to last instead of first item when pressing Shift-Tab the first time in the completion.
- Add a fullscreen keybinding.
- Add a `:search` command in addition to `/foo` so it's more visible and can be used from scripts.
- Various improvements to documentation, logging, and the crash reporter.
- Expand `~` to the users home directory with `:run-userscript`.
- Improve the userscript runner on Linux/macOS by using `QSocketNotifier`.
- Add luakit-like `gt`/`gT` keybindings to cycle through tabs.
- Show default value for config values in the completion.
- Clone tab icon, tab text and zoom level when cloning tabs.
- Don't open relative file paths with `:open`, only with commandline arguments.
- Expand environment variables in config settings which take a file path.
- Add a list of common user agents to the user agent setting completion.
- Move cursor to end of textboxes when hinting.
- Don't start searches on invalid URLs for quickmarks/startpage.
- Various performance improvements for the completion.
- Always open URLs given as argument in the foreground.
- Improve various error messages.
- Add `startpage`/`default-page` values to `tabs -> last-close`.
- Various improvements to `:restart` - it should be more robust now and uses sessions so all state (focused tab, scroll position, etc.) gets remembered.
- Add tab index display to the statusbar.
- Keep progress bar height fixed when the statusbar is multiline.
- Many improvements to tests and related infrastructure:
    * `init_venv.py` and `run_checks.py` have been replaced by http://tox.readthedocs.org/[tox]. Install tox and run `tox -e mkvenv` instead.
    * The tests now use http://pytest.org/[pytest]
    * Many new tests added
    * Mac Mini buildbot to run the tests on macOS.
    * Coverage recording via http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/[coverage.py].
    * New `--pdb-postmortem argument` to drop into the pdb debugger on exceptions.
    * Use https://github.com/ionelmc/python-hunter[hunter] for line tracing instead of a selfmade solution.

Deprecated
