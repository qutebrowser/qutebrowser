Getting help

Additionally, each command can be started with a `--help` flag to show its
help.
* IRC channel: irc://irc.freenode.org/#qutebrowser[`#qutebrowser`] on
http://freenode.net/[Freenode]
(https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#qutebrowser[webchat])

https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/qutebrowser[subscribe])

Donating
--------

Working on qutebrowser is a very rewarding hobby, but like (nearly) all hobbies
it also costs some money. Namely I have to pay for the server and domain, and
do occasional hardware upgrades footnote:[It turned out a 160 GB SSD is rather
small - the VMs and custom Qt builds I use for testing/developing qutebrowser
need about 100 GB of space].

If you want to give me a beer or a pizza back, I'm trying to make it as easy as
possible for you to do so. If some other way would be easier for you, please
get in touch!
