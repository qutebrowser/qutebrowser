NOTE: This page will only appear on the first start. To view it at a later
time, use the `:help` command.

Basic keybindings to get you started
------------------------------------

* Use the arrow keys or `hjkl` to move around a webpage (vim-like syntax is used in quite a few places)
* To go to a new webpage, press `o`, then type a url, then press Enter (Use `O` to open the url in a new tab, `go` to edit the current URL)
* If what you've typed isn't a url, then a search engine will be used instead (DuckDuckGo, by default)
* To switch between tabs, use `J` (next tab) and `K` (previous tab), or press `<Alt-num>`, where `num` is the position of the tab to switch to
* To close the current tab, press `d` (and press `u` to undo closing a tab)
* Use `H` and `L` to go back and forth in the history
* To click on something without using the mouse, press `f` to show the hints, then type the keys next to what you want to click on (if that sounds weird, then just try pressing `f` and see what happens)
* Press `:` to show the commandline
* To search in a page, press `/`, type the phrase to search for, then press Enter. Use `n` and `N` to go back and forth through the matches, and press Esc to stop doing the search.
* To close qutebrowser, press `Alt-F4`, or `:q`, or `:wq` to save the currently open tabs and quit (note that in the settings you can make qutebrowser always save the currently open tabs)

* There's also a https://www.shortcutfoo.com/app/dojos/qutebrowser[free training
  course] on shortcutfoo for the keybindings - note that you need to be in
  insert mode (i) for it to work.
* Run `:adblock-update` to download adblock lists and activate adblocking.
* If you just cloned the repository, you'll need to run
`scripts/asciidoc2html.py` to generate the documentation.
* Go to the link:qute://settings[settings page] to set up qutebrowser the way you want it.
* Subscribe to
https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/qutebrowser[the mailinglist] or
https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/qutebrowser-announce[the announce-only mailinglist].
* Let me know what features you are missing or things that need (even small!)
improvements.

Getting help
------------

If you get stuck, you can get help in multiple ways:

* The `:help` command inside qutebrowser shows the built-in documentation.
Additionally, each command can be started with a `--help` flag to show its
help.
* IRC channel: irc://irc.freenode.org/#qutebrowser[`#qutebrowser`] on
http://freenode.net/[Freenode]
(https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#qutebrowser[webchat])
* Mailinglist: mailto:qutebrowser@lists.qutebrowser.org[] (
https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/qutebrowser[subscribe])

Donating
--------

Working on qutebrowser is a very rewarding hobby, but like (nearly) all hobbies
it also costs some money. Namely I have to pay for the server and domain, and
do occasional hardware upgrades footnote:[It turned out a 160 GB SSD is rather
small - the VMs and custom Qt builds I use for testing/developing qutebrowser
need about 100 GB of space].

If you want to give me a beer or a pizza back, I'm trying to make it as easy as
possible for you to do so. If some other way would be easier for you, please
get in touch!
