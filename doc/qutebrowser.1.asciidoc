== NAME
qutebrowser - a keyboard-driven, vim-like browser based on PyQt5 and QtWebKit.

== SYNOPSIS
*qutebrowser* ['-OPTION' ['...']] [':COMMAND' ['...']] ['URL' ['...']]

== DESCRIPTION
qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It's based
on Python, PyQt5 and QtWebKit and free software, licensed under the GPL.

It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

Note the commands and settings of qutebrowser are not described in this
manpage, but in the help integrated in qutebrowser - use the ":help" command to
show it.
