- A new command `:paste-primary` got added to paste the primary selection, and
  `<Shift-Insert>` got added as a binding so it pastes primary rather than
  clipboard.

  for hints instead of single characters.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Pasting multiple lines via `:paste` now opens each line in a new tab.
- `:navigate increment/decrement` now preserves leading zeroes in URLs.

  magnet link).

  when using wayland.

- Link filtering for hints now checks if the text is contained anywhere in
  the link, and matches case-insensitively.

  finished. When set to `-1`, downloads are never removed.
- The `:follow-hint` command now optionally takes the keystring of a hint to
  follow.
- `:scroll-px` now doesn't take floats anymore, which made little sense.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- *Breaking change for userscripts:* `QUTE_HTML` and `QUTE_TEXT` for userscripts now don't store the contents directly, and instead contain a filename.
- The `content -> geolocation` and `notifications` settings now support a `true` value to always allow those. However, this is *not recommended*.

- Alternating row colors in completion. This adds a new `colors -> completion.alternate-bg` option.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Ignore quotes with maxsplit-commands (`:open`, `:quickmark-load`, etc.) and don't quote arguments for those commands in the completions. This also means some commands needed adjustments:
    * Clear search when `:search` without arguments is given.  (`:search ""` will now search for the literal text `""`)

- Don't open relative file paths with `:open`, only with commandline arguments.
- Expand environment variables in config settings which take a file path.
- Add a list of common user agents to the user agent setting completion.
- Move cursor to end of textboxes when hinting.

- Various performance improvements for the completion.
- Always open URLs given as argument in the foreground.
- Improve various error messages.
- Add `startpage`/`default-page` values to `tabs -> last-close`.
- Various improvements to `:restart` - it should be more robust now and uses sessions so all state (focused tab, scroll position, etc.) gets remembered.
- Add tab index display to the statusbar.
- Keep progress bar height fixed when the statusbar is multiline.
- Many improvements to tests and related infrastructure:
    * `init_venv.py` and `run_checks.py` have been replaced by http://tox.readthedocs.org/[tox]. Install tox and run `tox -e mkvenv` instead.
    * The tests now use http://pytest.org/[pytest]
    * Many new tests added
    * Mac Mini buildbot to run the tests on OS X.
    * Coverage recording via http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/[coverage.py].
