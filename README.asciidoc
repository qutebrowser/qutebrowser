// QUTE_WEB_HIDE_END

qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It's based
on Python, PyQt5 and QtWebKit and free software, licensed under the GPL.

It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

Requirements
------------

The following software and libraries are required to run qutebrowser:

* http://www.python.org/[Python] 3.4 or newer
* http://qt.io/[Qt] 5.2.0 or newer (5.5.1 recommended)
* QtWebKit
* http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro[PyQt] 5.2.0 or newer
(5.5.1 recommended) for Python 3
* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/[pkg_resources/setuptools]
* http://fdik.org/pyPEG/[pyPEG2]
* http://jinja.pocoo.org/[jinja2]
* http://pygments.org/[pygments]
* http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML[PyYAML]

The following libraries are optional and provide a better user experience:

* http://cthedot.de/cssutils/[cssutils]

To generate the documentation for the `:help` command, when using the git
repository (rather than a release), http://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc] is needed.

On Windows, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama/[colorama] is needed to
display colored log output.

See link:INSTALL.asciidoc[INSTALL] for directions on how to install qutebrowser
and its dependencies.

Donating
--------

Working on qutebrowser is a very rewarding hobby, but like (nearly) all hobbies
it also costs some money. Namely I have to pay for the server and domain, and
do occasional hardware upgrades footnote:[It turned out a 160 GB SSD is rather
small - the VMs and custom Qt builds I use for testing/developing qutebrowser
need about 100 GB of space].

If you want to give me a beer or a pizza back, I'm trying to make it as easy as
possible for you to do so. If some other way would be easier for you, please
get in touch!
