on Python and PyQt5 and free software, licensed under the GPL.

It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

  - QtCore / qtbase
  - QtQuick (part of qtbase in some distributions)
  - QtSQL (part of qtbase in some distributions)
  - QtOpenGL
  - QtWebEngine, or
  - QtWebKit - only the
    link:https://github.com/annulen/webkit/wiki[updated fork] (5.212) is
    supported
* http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro[PyQt] 5.7.0 or newer
  (5.10 recommended) for Python 3
* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/[pkg_resources/setuptools]

  with QtWebKit).
* On Windows, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama/[colorama] for colored log
  output.
* http://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc] to generate the documentation for the `:help`
  command, when using the git repository (rather than a release).

See link:doc/install.asciidoc[the documentation] for directions on how to
install qutebrowser and its dependencies.

Donating
--------

Working on qutebrowser is a very rewarding hobby, but like (nearly) all hobbies
it also costs some money. Namely I have to pay for the server and domain, and
do occasional hardware upgrades footnote:[It turned out a 160 GB SSD is rather
small - the VMs and custom Qt builds I use for testing/developing qutebrowser
need about 100 GB of space].

If you want to give me a beer or a pizza back, I'm trying to make it as easy as
possible for you to do so. If some other way would be easier for you, please
get in touch!
