// QUTE_WEB_HIDE_END

qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It's based
on Python and PyQt5 and free software, licensed under the GPL.

It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

See the https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/releases[github releases
page] for available downloads and the link:doc/install.asciidoc[INSTALL] file for
detailed instructions on how to get qutebrowser running on various platforms.

Documentation and getting help
------------------------------

Please see the link:doc/help/index.asciidoc[help page] for available documentation
pages and support channels.

Contributions / Bugs
--------------------

You want to contribute to qutebrowser? Awesome! Please read
link:doc/contributing.asciidoc[the contribution guidelines] for details and
useful hints.

If you found a bug or have a feature request, you can report it in several
ways:

* Use the built-in `:report` command or the automatic crash dialog.
* Open an issue in the Github issue tracker.
* Write a mail to the
https://lists.schokokeks.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/qutebrowser[mailinglist] at
mailto:qutebrowser@lists.qutebrowser.org[].

For security bugs, please contact me directly at mail@qutebrowser.org, GPG ID
https://www.the-compiler.org/pubkey.asc[0x916eb0c8fd55a072].

Requirements
------------

The following software and libraries are required to run qutebrowser:

* https://www.python.org/[Python] 3.6.1 or newer
* https://www.qt.io/[Qt] 5.12.0 or newer (5.12 LTS or 5.15 recommended, Qt 6 is
  not supported yet) with the following modules:
  - QtCore / qtbase
  - QtQuick (part of qtbase or qtdeclarative in some distributions)
  - QtSQL (part of qtbase in some distributions)
  - QtDBus (part of qtbase in some distributions; note that a connection to DBus at
    runtime is optional)
  - QtOpenGL
  - QtWebEngine, or
  - alternatively QtWebKit (5.212) - **This is not recommended** due to known security
    issues in QtWebKit, you most likely want to use qutebrowser with the
    default QtWebEngine backend (based on Chromium) instead. Quoting the
    https://github.com/qtwebkit/qtwebkit/releases[QtWebKit releases page]:
    _[The latest QtWebKit] release is based on [an] old WebKit revision with known
unpatched vulnerabilities. Please use it carefully and avoid visiting untrusted
websites and using it for transmission of sensitive data._
* https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro[PyQt] 5.12.0 or newer
  for Python 3
* https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/[jinja2]
* https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml[PyYAML]

On older Python versions (3.6/3.7/3.8), the following backports are also required:

* https://importlib-resources.readthedocs.io/[importlib_resources] (Python 3.8 or older)
* https://github.com/ericvsmith/dataclasses[dataclasses] (Python 3.6 only)

The following libraries are optional:

* https://pypi.org/project/adblock/[adblock] (for improved adblocking using ABP syntax)
* https://pygments.org/[pygments] for syntax highlighting with `:view-source`
  on QtWebKit, or when using `:view-source --pygments` with the (default)
  QtWebEngine backend.
* On Windows, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama/[colorama] for colored log
  output.
* https://importlib-metadata.readthedocs.io/[importlib_resources] on Python 3.7
  or older, to improve QtWebEngine version detection when PyQtWebEngine is
  installed via pip (thus, this dependency usually isn't relevant for
  packagers).
* https://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc] to generate the documentation for the `:help`
  command, when using the git repository (rather than a release).

See link:doc/install.asciidoc[the documentation] for directions on how to
install qutebrowser and its dependencies.

Donating

GitHub Sponsors allows for one-time donations (using the buttons next to "Select a

is the preferred donation method.** GitHub uses https://stripe.com/[Stripe] to accept
payment via credit carts without any fees. Billing via PayPal is available as well, with
less fees than a direct PayPal transaction.

Alternatively, the following donation methods are available -- note that
eligibility for swag (shirts/stickers/etc.) is handled on a case-by-case basis

Sponsors
--------

Thanks a lot to https://www.macstadium.com/[MacStadium] for supporting
qutebrowser with a free hosted Mac Mini via their
https://www.macstadium.com/opensource[Open Source Project].

(They don't require including this here - I've just been very happy with their
offer, and without them, no macOS releases or tests would exist)

Thanks to the https://www.hsr.ch/[HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil], which
made it possible to work on qutebrowser extensions as a student research project.

Additionally, the following people have contributed graphics:

* Jad/link:https://yelostudio.com[yelo] (new icon)
