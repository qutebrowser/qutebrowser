qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It's based
on Python and PyQt5 and free software, licensed under the GPL.

It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

Sponsors
--------

Thanks a lot to https://www.macstadium.com/[MacStadium] for supporting
qutebrowser with a free hosted Mac Mini via their
https://www.macstadium.com/opensource[Open Source Project].

(They don't require including this here - I've just been very happy with their
offer, and without them, no macOS releases or tests would exist)

Thanks to the https://www.hsr.ch/[HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil], which
made it possible to work on qutebrowser extensions as a student research project.
