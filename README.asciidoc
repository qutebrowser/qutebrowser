on Python and PyQt5 and free software, licensed under the GPL.

It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

Requirements
------------

The following software and libraries are required to run qutebrowser:

* https://www.python.org/[Python] 3.5 or newer (3.6 recommended)
* https://www.qt.io/[Qt] 5.7.1 or newer (5.12 recommended, support for < 5.9
  will be dropped soon) with the following modules:
  - QtCore / qtbase
  - QtQuick (part of qtbase in some distributions)
  - QtSQL (part of qtbase in some distributions)
  - QtOpenGL
  - QtWebEngine, or
  - alternatively QtWebKit - support for QtWebKit will be dropped soon, and
    only the link:https://github.com/annulen/webkit/wiki[updated fork] (5.212)
    is supported
* https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro[PyQt] 5.7.0 or newer
  (5.12 recommended, support for < 5.9 will be dropped soon) for Python 3
* https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/[pkg_resources/setuptools]
* https://fdik.org/pyPEG/[pyPEG2]

* https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml[PyYAML]
* https://www.attrs.org/[attrs]

The following libraries are optional:

* http://cthedot.de/cssutils/[cssutils] (for an improved `:download --mhtml`
  with QtWebKit).
* On Windows, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama/[colorama] for colored log
  output.
* http://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc] to generate the documentation for the `:help`
  command, when using the git repository (rather than a release).

See link:doc/install.asciidoc[the documentation] for directions on how to
install qutebrowser and its dependencies.

Donating
--------

Working on qutebrowser is a very rewarding hobby, but like (nearly) all hobbies
it also costs some money. Namely I have to pay for the server and domain, and
do occasional hardware upgrades footnote:[It turned out a 160 GB SSD is rather
small - the VMs and custom Qt builds I use for testing/developing qutebrowser
need about 100 GB of space].

If you want to give me a beer or a pizza back, I'm trying to make it as easy as
possible for you to do so. If some other way would be easier for you, please
get in touch!

Sponsors
--------

Thanks a lot to https://www.macstadium.com/[MacStadium] for supporting
qutebrowser with a free hosted Mac Mini via their
https://www.macstadium.com/opensource[Open Source Project].

(They don't require including this here - I've just been very happy with their
offer, and without them, no macOS releases or tests would exist)

Thanks to the https://www.hsr.ch/[HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil], which
made it possible to work on qutebrowser extensions as a student research project.
