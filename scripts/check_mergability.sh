# How to run:
# * Install the gh cli and run `gh login`: https://github.com/cli/cli/
# * install black isort usort pyupgrade and whatever other tools you want to
#   play with in your active virtualenv
# * also requires "sponge" from moreutils
# * move to a new folder for the script to work in: `mkdir pr_mergability && cd pr_mergability`
# * ../scripts/check_mergability.sh
#
# It'll clone the qutebrowser repo, fetch refs for all the open PRs, checkout
# a branch, run auto formatters, try to merge each PR, report back via CSV
# how badly each merge filed (via "number of conflicting lines").
#
# For details of what auto formatters are ran see the `tools` variable down
# near the bottom of the script.
#
# If you've checked out a branch and ran auto-formatters or whatever on it
# manually and just want the script to try to merge all PRs you can call it
# with the branch name and it'll do so. Remember to go back up to the work dir
# before calling the script.
#
# If it's been a few days and PRs have been opened or merged delete `prs.json`
# from the working dir to have them re-fetched on next run.
# If PRs have had updates pushed you'll have to update the refs yourself or
# nuke the whole clone in the work dir and let the script re-fetch them all.

# requires the github binary, authorized, to list open PRs.

summary

# todo:
# * see if we can run formatters on PR branches before/while merging
# * do most stuff based off of qt6-v2 instead of master, not like most PRs
#   will be merged to pre-3.0 master anyway
# * for strategies where we skip PRs that failed in master include them in the
#   report to for reference. With a marker to that affect and a total diffstat
#   so we can see how big they are
# * *try the more simplistic "Run the formatter on all PR branches then merge"
#   instead of trying to do it via a rebase*
# * try rebasing them to an autoformatted qt6-v2 branch
# notes:
# after merging qt6-v2 would merging old PRs to old master then somehow merging
#   the PR merge commit up to the new master easier than rebasing the PR?
# there is a filter attribute you can use to re-write files before committing.
#   For this use case probably the same as rebase -i --exec then merge?
#   >See "Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout attributes" in gitattributes(5)
# if we go with the strategy of rebasing PRs on formatted commits how to deal
#   with stopping isort making import loops on every damn PR. Still need to try
#   rebasing directly on the latest formatted master instead of doing the
#   intermediated one.
