        <h1>Welcome to the qutebrowser mhtml test page</h1>
        
        <div class="dyk">
        ...that the word <em>qutebrowser</em> is a word play on Qt, the
        framework the browser is built with?
        </div>
        
        <h2>What is this page?</h2>
        
        <p>This page is a test-case for the mhtml download feature of
        qutebrowser. Under normal circumstances, you won't see this page, except
        if you're a qutebrowser developer <em>or</em> you're attending one of
        The-Compiler's pytest demos.</p>
        
        <div class="dyk">
        ...that this page was once a monstrosity with <em>"this weird pixelated
        globe with the geocities-like background"</em>? You can find the old
        page in the old commits and indeed, it was quite atrocious. But hey,
        every browser needs a globe...
        </div>
        
        <p>This page references other assets and when the page is downloaded,
        qutebrowser checks if each asset was downloaded. If some assets are
        missing, the test fails and the poor developers have to search for the
        error.</p>
        
        <h2>Can I contribute to qutebrowser?</h2>
        
        <p>Yes!</p>
        
        <div class="dyk">
        ...that qutebrowser is free software? Free as in <em>free beer</em> and
        <em>free speech</em>! Isn't that great?</em>
        </div>
        
        <h2>...and how?</h2>
        
        <p>See <a href="https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/contributing.asciidoc">
        here</a> for more information.</p>
        
        <h2>More useless trivia!</h2>
                
        <div class="dyk">
        ...that the font in the header is Comic Sans?
        </div>
        
        <div class="dyk">
        ...the IRC channel for qutebrowser is <code>#qutebrowser</code> on
        irc.libera.chat
        </div>
        
        <div class="dyk">
        ...the area of a circle is &pi;*r<sup>2</sup>?
        </div>
        
        <p>To make this page a bit useful, I've included a chessboard, so you
        can play chess. Just turn your screen 90 degrees, such that it forms a
        flat, horizontal surface (you can skip this step if you're using a
        tablet). Next, zoom the page until it fits your needs. Enjoy your round
        of chess!</p>
