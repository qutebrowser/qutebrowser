IMPORTANT: *Currently, bigger changes are going on in qutebrowser, as
part of a
https://lists.schokokeks.org/pipermail/qutebrowser-announce/2018-September/000051.html[student research project]
about adding a plugin API to qutebrowser and moving a lot of code from the code
into plugins.* Due to that, bandwidth for pull request review is currently
very limited, and contributions might lead to merge conflicts due to
ongoing refactorings.

- Before you start to work on something, please leave a comment on the relevant
  issue (or open one). This makes sure there is no duplicate work done.

- Either run the testsuite locally, or keep an eye on Travis CI / AppVeyor
  after pushing changes.

- If you are stuck somewhere or have questions,
  https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser#getting-help[please ask]!
