IMPORTANT: I'm currently (July 2018) more busy than usual until September,
because of exams coming up. Review of non-trivial pull requests will thus be
delayed until then. If you're reading this note after mid-September, please
open an issue.

- Before you start to work on something, please leave a comment on the relevant
  issue (or open one). This makes sure there is no duplicate work done.

- Either run the testsuite locally, or keep an eye on Travis CI / AppVeyor
  after pushing changes.

- If you are stuck somewhere or have questions,
  https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser#getting-help[please ask]!
